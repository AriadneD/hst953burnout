Extreme stress at work has caught up with me,"Like the title says, I have been under extreme stress at work (long hours, including weekends and a lot of pressure) and it has caught up with me. My manager adjusted my workload recently but it’s still a lot and in some ways it is added responsibility. I have recently been spoken to about my communication, which in a couple of instances was harsh. I’m struggling with burnout and not handling stress well.

"What career/jobs are there for me, a chemistry graduate that don’t require further study?","Hi all I hope you’re well!

I have a bachelors in chemistry and have worked in IT however I have grown tired of having to constantly study and keep up to date with my skills after work. After doing my degree I guess I just got burned out with studying as it was very difficult and mentally draining. I’m looking for a change into a career that can give me a decent salary a month where I wouldn’t need to be studying for certifications or sitting exams 

If that’s possible?

What do publishing companies provide writers?,"I want to publish a book but I have a few questions before I go forwards.

1. What do publishing companies provide to writers? They take a large percentage of the book's income so I want to know what I would be getting in return.
2. How much do they spend per author? I know it varies on the popularity, but on average, for an author's first publish, what do they spend for the author in terms of marketing (not including printing the book).

I can't think of any other questions at the moment, but if you think of anything else that's important, please comment. (I also posted this in a different subreddit, but I realize there are a lot of published authors here so I'd like to hear from people who have experience).",writing,1728582531,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

Financial gift for 14 year old family member,"A 14 year old in my family is celebrating an important religious milestone, and in our family, the norm is to give money as a gift for this type of occasion. 

When I was her age, my grandparents bought me government savings bonds (EE). This was in the 90s and the rates were more attractive than they are now. I think the rate for an EE bond is 2.7%, which isn’t great but is better than the money sitting in a checking account or something. I’m also afraid that she’ll spend it on something frivolous because she’s so young, and her guardians don’t always teach her the value of money. I would love for my gift to grow and maybe I could also teach her the value of saving and interest. 

Another idea I have is to open a high yield savings account for her, and deposit the money into there. 

Either way, I’d have to have her mom set up a Treasury Direct account for the bond, or a savings account for the cash. 

She is very important to me and I want to give her something meaningful and lasting. I’ll also get her a little something to ‘open’ the day of. 

Do you have any other ideas for gifts that would somewhat ensure that she saves the money, and that would teach her a little bit about finances? ",personalfinance,1728655379,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

I’m failing at life. Don’t know how to dig myself out of this!,"I have really dug myself into a hole and I have to figure some stuff out. 
I have been taking major steps to get myself out of this mess, but it’s not going to happen overnight. 
I’ve been hesitant to even post anything on here but I am so disappointed in myself.
It all started from terrible life decisions but now I’m really screwed. I got a bad performance review at my job a few weeks ago and I was basically walking on thin ice with them. I knew I was about to get fired due to attendance so I kind of just resigned on my own. I spiraled into a depression and binge drinking which I know I cannot do. I made sure to have a temporary job lined up but it’s a steep decrease in pay, $12 pay cut and it’s not always 40 hours a week since it’s a state job and they are all paid on salary. 
I have a God awful car loan at 25 percent APR. I bought it out of desperation because I could not get approved for anything and I figured my credit score would increase and I could refinance it. That didn’t happen and I’ve now paid $25,000 on a $15,000 car and I’ll still have another $21,000 to pay. I’m behind on two months of payments and I know I just need to let the car go. The only problem is I have zero dollars to put towards a new car. I do have my uncles who are helping me car shop. I’m not expecting them to loan the money but they’ve been generous in the past so theres a possibility that I might get some help.

I have legal fees for custody of my son. I basically got screwed for agreeing to take all of the GAL fees in order to get my ex to agree on some things. The judge and GAL are taking me to court and I’ve almost been thrown in jail for not appearing one time. I’ve been making the payments of $200 a month and I’ve tried to let them know about my financial hardships but they don’t care to hear it. The fact that I was almost booked in jail and I have 2 young children fully depending on me really gutted me inside. 

I’m $600 behind on my $1100 rent payment. My landlord is sick of me paying late and I wouldn’t be surprised if I get evicted. 
I have interviewed for 2 jobs I’m nearly certain I will get an offer for. I’ve also contacted a crisis housing center to see if I might qualify for permanent housing. I don’t collect SSI, but I do have a disability which makes me eligible. I wish I had family or a friend to stay with but I don’t want to place that burden on anyone. I’ve asked before and I don’t want to beg at this point. 

Here’s a few other things I’ve done: 

*Interviewed and hired 2 night and weekend state licensed sitters so I can work a few other jobs (part time)
*set up a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney 
*called a few trusted family members to ask for their advice 
*reached out to churches and typed up and email explaining my situation - they did not respond or they sent a list of local resources
*accepted a job offer for a part time job (will start Oct 25 &amp; 26th)
* set up an interview with a children’s clothing thrift store. I figure I can utilize a discount for clothing which wouldn’t hurt! 
*considered renting out a room but I’m iffy on that since I have young children
*called my water company and worked out a payment plan so it doesn’t get shut off 
*received utility assistance 
*cut off internet and streaming for now 
*sold my camera 
*advertised to do bookkeeping for small businesses 
*applied for FT jobs that pay better and interviewed 
* made sure my meds are adjusted so I can avoid spiraling and repeating the cycle 
* considered donating plasma but I need to utilize a sitter while I do that 
*considered applying for child support but ex is violent and we had a no stalking order in place - iffy on that too

I am open for a criticism and advice here. I feel like a bad person and bad mom. I wish things were going better and I feel completely depleted.",personalfinance,1728663441,nonburnedout,burnedout

Any of the things normal in a workplace? ,"Unhappy. Unfulfilled. Toxic environment. Low pay. Burnt out. 


I’m sure some/all of you can relate. Share your story - geographical region, approx age, approx wage, profession, what you are struggling with, etc. 


I’m 30(F), living in Canada, working as a paralegal - 10 years in the legal field in total (was a legal assistant and then became a paralegal in 2023) I am making 77K

Things I despise about my profession/or mostly my firm, or the people I work with:

(Are any of the things below NORMAL? Honestly HATE how some firms operate, but I also know same shit diff pile for every work place so it boils down to what you can accept and can’t lol)

-texts before my starting time of 9am and after working hours (I know right? I will formally make a complaint after I find another job)

-texts advising that I need to call them once I am at work (especially when I am working from home) which is at 9am - over very insignificant matters that could be an email

-inefficient/inexperienced lawyers: always wanting/needing everything on a rush when it’s not necessary, inexperienced lawyers with unnecessary anxiety - putting you on edge every other day.

-just the other day, I was working from home, I had 22 phone calls with one of my lawyer in preparing court documents back and forth and between 5 people, but is it really necessary?

-constantly being pulled in 50 different directions

-firm is whack, needing people to work with other and additional lawyers cause we are understaffed. I am currently working with two lawyers, and one additional lawyer on one file. 

-most people did not get a raise this year 

-colleagues are generally toxic in the workplace, love to gossip and stir drama (will also be making a formal complaint on a certain individual that continues to stir drama around the office and tries to get me involved when I clearly DO NOT. Good thing is she pretends I am invisible now (: )

-Management are complete snakes, constantly making false promises to new employees that joins the firm, is extremely cheap, manipulates people by not being truthful, and never fulfilling people’s needs or wants

-Snarky and inexperienced staffs acting like they know what is going on better than you do but they’re just a bunch of weirdos wearing the lawyer hat to perform tricks. If I could say this: you’re not even a decent lawyer  or know what you are doing for the most part. Sit your ass down before someone hands your inexperienced ass to you before a judge.

-most people work remote, and people who are 100% from other locations love to email people in our location to prepare documents for them in person. I always get tasked from those people, am sick and tired of their sloppy work that I need to clean up - while they let me know the morning of the deadline, they log off at 12pm, ditch the ball to me to revise and finalize their sloppy work and for me to have things filed. I have raised this with my lawyer that I cannot operate like this. Last time, I was tasked at 10:40am and then the deadline was at 12pm. To revise, finalize and file sets of application and affidavit materials working from home. LMAO.

I hate God and it's killing me.,"I hate God. The thought of Him gives me migraines. I get sick to my stomach when I pray. Church causes me physical pain. Even writing this is making me irritable.

My boyfriend of two years is very Christian and religion is a sore spot between us. I know that he wishes I shared his faith or conviction, but I don't. I doubt I ever will. We've fought about it before. Sometimes I wonder if he'd love me more if I *did* echo his beliefs. I've tried time and time again for his sake, but it's all empty. 

I was sexually, emotionally and physically abused for almost all of my life. Every man who assaulted me claimed to be a man of God. A devout Catholic, a Pastor's son, a man who had just finished seminary school. I've already accepted that I will likely never truly heal from it, and to dull the disgust I feel when thinking about it, I just tell myself it wasn't that bad. That helps to a degree.

But every time I try to find solace in God, it resurfaces, and I hate myself for experiencing it, I hate my abusers for doing it, and I hate God for allowing it. I feel so much rage that all I can do is cry. 

The men that did this to me will never really face justice for what they did, and that's fine. It seems the world rewards evil anyway.

But when does this pain end? Therapy, acceptance, prayer, forgiveness, charity - not a single thing has worked to heal this anger and evilness in me. I rarely feel joyful, or excited, or content. I spend my days stewing over what I've lived through, barely getting by, almost never sleeping. I never have a moment of peace.

I come back looking for answers to what's wrong with me and am told the same thing over and over: accept it, let yourself be hurt, work through it. How do I work through this? Am I what happened to me, or was it all meaningless? Is the answer four different medications and a psychiatrist or a God that the mere notion of causes me pain?

I have come to God completely broken, at both ten and twenty years old, begging for healing or even a moment of respite.

I have nothing. I know nothing except that this is eating me alive and I no longer see a point in anything. I don't want a Bible verse and I don't want pills. I just want it to stop.",Christianity,1728662388,nonburnedout,burnedout
Friend(27f) who rejected me (29m) a few months ago is now giving me gifts and asking me on what I feel like are dates or at least blurring the lines. Best way to have a conversation about boundaries?,"
Okay so messy incoming but the bullet points are essentially “Sally” had a huge crush on me at the start of our friendship 3 years ago. We were “talk every few weeks hang out in groups friends” etc. about a year in she made a move on me after we hung out 1:1 for the first time in months (I was interested, but she told me she couldn’t do a long term relationship with anyone as she was maybe moving in two months for career) I declined her advances as I don’t like casual hookups with friends, and she distanced herself after this. We didn’t talk for two or 3 months, her job offer unfortunately fell thru, we reconnected. I reproached if there was still interest, she said she had gotten over it, and hoped we could remain friends. Two months later we kept hanging out and seemed closer so I reasked, and she told me she was for sure over it and saw me like a brother now. I agreed to stay friends but backed off a bit.

We both started seeing someone casually, and went back to casual talk every few days/ every other week friends, maybe hung out alone once or twice a few times that summer.

Both of our relationships ended around July, and she really took the initiative in being my friend. She would FaceTime me every day we were both free, text me plans, group dinners etc. for the past 3 months, most of her friends would act like they thought something was happening between us, though a mutual friend told me she didn’t feel like there was anything there. 

Except a lot of the contact has crossed wires with me again and I feel the need to talk to her about it. She’s started cooking me food weekly, whenever I make plans in the group or plan on things she interjects and says “what are we doing” even if it’s something she doesn’t want to do, or “do we have plans this weekend/tuesday”?

Started asking to come over after work 2-3 times a week and stopping by my apt to cook dinner together, we have tv shows she only wants to watch with me, couple activities just the two of us should do(Apple picking etc). I have no problem doing stuff 1:1 with my girl friends, but the amount of the contact and activities is over the platonic line for me (and every single one of my 3rd party girl friends has told me this as well)

I wasn’t sure I was uncomfy until she bought me concert tickets this past week for a fairly intimate show this past weekend, and then when I told her I’d Uber us home as I was tired she asked me to walk her home instead of ubering us and took me to a park she wanted to go to and walked us on a walk on the beach and kept asking me if I was sure I wanted to not stay out,then started planning an out of state trip for the two of us, alongside leaving the country on vacation next year with just us two and a mutual couple friend, and then she kept invading my personal bubble (I’m not a touchy person at all, she isn’t really either so this made me uncomfortable)

I’m big on boundaries so I’ve been really strict on myself to not flirt act inappropriate etc but now she brings up sexual topics we had talked about years ago “remember when you told me you were into doing X lmao” and stuff like that. But I don’t know a good way to bring this up or have this conversation? In any other circumstance I would ask her for dinner because I would view this as interest past platonic, but I’ve already been shot down twice so it feels inappropriate to ask her. Is there a healthy way to talk about this? Or could someone maybe help me with a “script” of sorts? I care about our friendship but I want to find a partner and our friendship has already crossed that “closeness” to me that if either of us start dating someone seriously I will need to exit or back out significantly to not be emotionally cheating.

TLDR: girl who’s rejected me is now buying me concert tickets and cooking dinner for me, planning trips, and other things. I want to talk to her about this but not sure I can find the words to do so",relationships,1728573694,nonburnedout,burnedout
Comic relief in novel about suicide?,"I'm writing a novel about suicide in a third world country with a lot of bad stigma towards mental health in general and I'm trying to portray that it's a big problem that people overlook.
I showed a few samples to a friend who is more of a screenwriter than a writer actually, he's directed a few TV ads as well. He says that the book having an overall depressing vibe isn't going to make it a good book or make it sell and that it will do the opposite of raising awareness towards the problem. He suggested that I tackle it in a more humorous way or have some comic relief. I don't know how I feel about this but what I do know is that this book is talking about the worst phases of chronic depression, the main character is doing her unfinished business before committing suicide at the end of the book (not a spoiler) and the novel follows her as she does those things and her messy thoughts, her messy past, her relationships with those around her, her mental illness at its core and I feel like comedy has no place in the middle except maybe a scene or two and it will be forced.

Have to go back to work soon but i’m still completely burned out. Advice? ,"Hey everyone. About 3 weeks ago I developed an aura migraine that took me to the ER. I’ve mostly beat that at this point but that migraine also was the final straw that lead to this complete and utter burnout i’m still feeling. It brought out this horrible anxiety/panic disorder that I…think I had for a long time but repressed? Yeah I know that’s on me. I have ADHD which doesn’t help either. Anyways, I took a short Leave of absence from my job but unfortunately i’m being forced by my dad to go back this Sunday. 



  Thing is, i’m NOT ready to go back at all and i’m absolutely terrified. Petrified. I’m crying while typing this because i’m so scared to go back. I’m physically and mentally very weak still and the idea of having to go back to that very physically/mentally taxing job for 8 1/2 hrs a day is unfeasible. I’ve asked to switch to an easier department and/or cut my hours back but got denied because the machines wearing flesh that run the show don’t have feelings. The obvious answer is to just quit but I can’t do that because I need the insurance and $$ of course. And i’m in no mental state to get a new job. 

During my LoA i’ve been taking it easy on myself while trying my best to heal. I completely cut caffeine, very sugary/fatty foods, and alcohol from my diet. Drinking only water, smoothies, and protein shakes. I struggle with food but I try to eat simple healthy things. I go with my mom (my hero throughout all this) and my dog and go on short walks/hikes almost every day. I made small achievements like getting my hair cut, deep cleaning parts of the house, go through and donating stuff, ect. This is all a struggle to do but i’m doing it to try to get back to some normalcy and prepare myself to go back to work. 

But i’m not sure it’s helping. I’m still having random panic attacks every few hours. And one always before bed and soon as I wake up. I was given some anxiety meds in the meantime which takes the edge off for sure but i’m still barely functioning. I’m finally doing what I should have done years ago which is see a psychiatrist and neurologist but they are 1 and 5(!) months out respectively (thanks American health care system). I’ve been practicing anxiety breathing exercises ALOT but I still don’t feel like I have a good grasp on them. I’ve tried meditation but I feel like you need to have a “minds eye” for that to work and I don’t. Look up Aphantasia if you’re curious. 

I don’t know what else to do. I want nothing more than to give up. I want to tell my dad to shove it and let me take more time off but I can’t. What else can I do to cope with this severe panic/burnout? I’ll take any ideas at this point. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. ",burnedout,1727885428,burnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

I can’t get on the same page with my boyfriend about finances,"I’m a 27F and my boyfriend is 24M.

We’ve been together for about a year and we live together. We’re honestly in a pretty bad financial spot. He and I both have a lot of debt, and his credit cards are entirely maxed out to a 15K limit. Our savings accounts are empty. 

I’ve been working on paying off all my debt so I can be financially free. That is my number one goal for the next 6 months, and I know I can pay off all my CC debt (roughly $8K) in that time as long as I stay focused. 

I make more money than my boyfriend does, and also he is an undocumented immigrant, so his job opportunities are limited.

When I started dating him, I knew he didn’t have a lot of money, but I loved him for who he was.

Now that I’m almost a year into this relationship, I’m starting to realize that my boyfriend and I have very different views on finances. 

For example, my boyfriend is really into music festivals and he has spent thousands of dollars attending them this year. 

I have tagged along to a couple of them—because one time, when I told him I couldn’t go to one, he started crying and guilt tripped me into going. (But now he’s pulling the good ol’ “I didn’t force you to go”)

He could not pay his portion of the rent this month, (we split 50/50) so I had to cover part of it. I didn’t complain about that at first, but now he’s already planning to go to another festival in February instead of saving for our BILLS or paying off his credit cards. He is also going to a smaller event this month (in my opinion, he should sell his ticket).

But here’s the worst part. Whenever I try to have an adult conversation about this with him, he will either completely shut down or he’ll lash out at me and complain about things like me not helping out around the house or saying that I work too much and I should help him more, or all these other excuses that are irrelevant to the actual problem—which is our financial issues. He’s not open to having a productive conversation about it.

I’m so frustrated that I’m starting to wonder if I should kick him out and pay for our entire apartment myself. I make enough money to do so.

Any advice on how I can navigate this situation? I hate doing things that are too extreme, but I feel like I’m out of options.

Accepting a counter-offer ? [N/A],"
I posted earlier about being stuck between two job offers, both with a 50% pay increase. Now, things have taken an unexpected turn, and I could use your advice.

For some context, I’ve been the only HR professional at a brick factory for the past three years. When I joined, the company was just starting, and I took care of everything—recruitment, payroll, compliance, safety, employee relations. It was a great learning experience, but as the company grew, the workload became overwhelming. Despite all my efforts and postive feedback, I didn’t get any raise over the past three years, and I’ve been feeling burnt out and underappreciated.

The company is also expecting to launch a new production site in the same factory by the end of the year.

I applied elsewhere, and things went well. I now have two offers with a 50% increase in pay. One is for an HRBP role at a multinational, focusing on fieldwork and union relations, and the other is for an HR Manager role at a local company, where I’d manage three assistants and take on more strategic responsibilities. Both roles have their pros and cons, and I’ve been trying to decide between them.

But then, the CEO called me in for a meeting. To my surprise, he was very positive and eager to keep me. He told me to take a week off and said that once I returned to headquarters, we’d sit down and discuss a new offer. He made it clear that his counteroffer would exceed anything I’ve received from the other companies. I told him directly that if I were to stay, I’d need a promotion and a significant raise, and he seemed confident that we could make that happen.

Now I’m conflicted. I feel like I finally have the leverage I’ve been missing all this time, but I also worry that even with a promotion or a raise, things could go back to the way they were—too much work and not enough support. On top of that, I know my profile is in demand. I have a pretty good success rate when applying elsewhere, so I don’t feel stuck.

Should I take this chance to negotiate a great deal with my current company, or would it be smarter to move on and take one of the two offers I already have? Part of me feels like staying would mean building on what I’ve already accomplished, but I’m also afraid of repeating the same burnout.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from people who’ve been in a similar situation. Thanks for reading.",humanresources,1728840103,burnedout,burnedout

Have I reached my limits?,"The last ten years have been just exhaustion and chaos. Between, the military, deployed, working full time and getting a bachelor's and masters degree in the first five years was rough. Then my wife and I finally got situated in our dream home, both working, and living comfortable. Then she got pregnant, which should have been magical time. Then when she was 4 months pregnant, she lost her job and everything just spiraled. 

First she could not find another job at 4 months, so we burned through what little savings and racked up a lot of credit card debt because we had to make up for her income, so we hoped to keep the house. We ended up losing the house anyways right before my child was born. Luckily, I got offered a job that took us across the state, but paid more then ehqta we were making together.

I have been at this job for almost two years, and I hate it so much. Its just a very toxic place and I have ended up with anxiety, depression and I have episodes of panic attacks. Yet, it pays way too much especailly in this economy. I was literally about to enter my dream field before this, but the pay was significantly lower.

My wife pretty much just decided she was not going to go back to work and just stay at home with our child. I agreed to this. We could only afford a ""fixer upper"" because the interest rates have skyrocketed. Outer last house was a 2% and now we have a 6.5%. So now, I end up working on a house all weekend trying to make it nicer because it does need the work. 

Last year, I startted learning a gaming engine (Unity) because game developement is my dream job. I wanted to make my own small indie games for a hobby. I had made a pretty cool little game that took me months, but ny pc died and my cloud backup was corrupted for I lost it all. It was probably a good 40-60 hours of work gone. This is work I did AFTER everyone went to bed, so I was staying up till 1 or 2 am on work nights completing this stuff.

Now, I am just burned out. I don't want to watch TV, relax, talk to friends, go to work (still hate it anyways), do DIY house projects, work on game dev, play games, workout, and I can barely talk myself into playing with my son. This has all happened in a 3 year window.

"I'm a writer with ADHD, and i can't finish an outline because of the countless ideas i have. Please help!","

I am a writer with ADHD and i don't know how to progress with writing an outline for a story.



I watched and read many videos and stories about story structure. I have a few videos that made me understand it the most. And i've tried taking one idea i have and slowly write out an outline along with watching the video that breaks down the story structure. But not only have i ended up with countless ideas, it's not even in the same genre. So i have many scattered ideas saved up.

So i tried a different approach, work on characters for a bit, and then maybe i can organically come up with a plot. Same problem.

I would come up with a character, their struggles but there are COUNTLESS plots that the struggles and internal conflict can escalate. And again, it's not even limited to a single genre either.

And then i tried combining a relationship, an arc and a story. Like a father and son dynamic, how their relationship changes throughout the story and the type of plot. But i have countless of ideas of not only what kind of arc they will have, but the different plot and again, so many genres 

And it's not only that, i heavily struggle trying to figure out from whose pov my story could be in.

For example, i come up with a character, a struggle, their relationships. I have the character arc down. And again, i'm trying to come up with a plot.

But not only do i come up with different plots, but it also includes the character i'm focused on either being a main character, just a side character. A part of a multipov book, or  dual pov. Or involved in a single pov. 

I've tried many types of character worksheets, videos about how to develop characters, again, trying to focus on one idea. 

And i keep getting mentally bombarded with random scene ideas as well. And not only that, but i think of countless ways the same scene could go. And not only that, but i would think of existing scenes i have thought of and how they could connect. But again, there are ENDLESS possibilites, not just two or three.

For example, one of the million scene ideas is a father and son reunite the hospital.

It's not just the dialogue that changes, or how the character reacts that changes, but i can't tell if that scene belongs in a supernatural book, in an action book, in a slasher book, a horror book. And i again can't pick what lead to them reuniting at the hospital in the first place. And there are times where i don't even know if they should reunite at the hospital, or at an ambulance. Or at someone's house (i can't even decide on a single setting lol)

And the backstories of the characters and the relationships keeps changing as well

I tried making a list of my ideas when it came to a particular subject. Like what is the backstory of the father and son who goes through a story arc change while going through tough times.



But i literally can't pick which one i like more. Heck, i can't even choose if the father and son should be biologically related, or if they are step father and step son. Or if it's just a middle aged guy developing a fatherly bond with a young guy.



Sorry if this comes across as jumbled, i tried my best to edit this, a few times. Just ask specific questions, and i'll clarify what i mean

Burnt out and lost ,Hello I’ve been burnt out for about three years and I still am. It started when I was going to college and got to a class I failed 3 times and I just didn’t have the motivation or energy to go back I was emotionally drained so I took a break. I tried in that time to study IT on my own and maybe get a few certifications maybe even a new job I was hopeful but after a while I realized that I kept losing interest and I’d go in a different direction maybe networking or maybe security I thought then I just stopped but I would still start up vm here or there and just stare at it not really knowing what to do with it and then delete it. Then at the beginning of this I had a major medical problem and had to be in the hospital for a week. When I got home I felt like I was going to be ok like my burn out was over. I felt good for two weeks and now I’m back to square one back to not knowing which way to go. I feel so lost and exhausted and alone and like absolutely no one cares.

I'm done with my best friend.,"I’m a 21-year-old male, and my best friend and roommate is 20. However, there’s an issue between us. He never checks on me, even though I’ve been going through some very serious and traumatic events that have led to depression. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, but my friend seems to lack emotional intelligence. It’s always me who has to initiate contact. Recently, as my depression worsened, he still never asked if I was okay. When I confronted him about it, he said, ""I thought you didn’t need that kind of attention. I figured if you needed something, you'd ask; otherwise, I assumed you were fine.""

Sometimes, I feel like he doesn’t care at all, especially when he sees me in a bad mood. Everyone else asks how I’m doing, but he doesn’t. I know he loves me and wants to help, but I don’t think I can handle his personality anymore. I’m not saying he’s wrong; I understand it’s not fair to expect someone to take care of me all the time. However, I just wish he’d show a little concern. I don’t always have the energy to tell him when I’m feeling bad.

For example, today I’ve been bedridden with the flu and couldn’t even get up to cook for myself. He didn’t check on me or even ask how I was doing.

I’ve heard a quote that says, ""If you are the person who is always initiating and you start questioning your value in someone's heart, leave them and wait to see if they will notice or not."" I don’t know if this quote is misleading, but I really need your opinions. What should I do?

TL;DR: I (21M) am struggling with my friendship with my best friend/roommate (20M) because he never checks on me, even though I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It feels like I’m always the one initiating conversations, and he doesn’t seem to notice when I’m unwell, even when it’s obvious. I love him and know he cares, but I’m feeling hurt by his lack of emotional support. I heard a quote that says, “If you are always the one initiating, leave and see if they notice.” I don’t know if that’s good advice or not, but I need help deciding what to do.

We have some issues here and there that I'll upload on another post. But this thought has occurred to me ever since I was with my ex a couple years ago (it was a 5 year toxic relationship, very messy).

I don't know how to react when my girl gets flirted with unless she is specifically touched. Beyond that I just awkwardly laugh because I just don't know how to react. I have my own experience with brawls and it traumatized me to understand that fighting doesn't lead to anywhere (I grew up with a domestic abusive father who would beat me and my mom. I had many fistfights with him in the past. He is no longer involved in my life; Yes I have seeked therapy for my trauma, I'm at peace with what happened). I'm pretty much a pacificist. Am I cowardous for not being confrontational? How should I properly react? What do you guys think? I would love to read about your guy's experiences with this.

Girl told me (28 F) that bf (30 M) said he’s single. She was lying but my trust is still shattered. What should I do? ,"TL;DR: I was insecure at the start of the relationship and resulted in my bf hiding things from me. I have since gone to therapy and made a lot of improvements. We agreed that we will both be fully transparent and I’ll manage my own emotions. However since then I have discovered two instances that boundaries were murky between him and females. One time was a colleague who sent flirty messages, and the other time was an old crush. I feel like my trust is broken, and now I’m stuck feeling anxious and heartbroken. 

——-
Hi everyone, tricky situation here so grateful for your patience. Here it goes:

When we first started dating, my boyfriend was an excellent bf, he would show me texts from other girls if he suspected they had other intentions, and invite me to help him craft responses. However, I struggled with retrospective jealousy, and every conversation ended with me in tears. This eventually led him to stop telling me. 

I’ve since then done a lot of work with therapist, and no longer suffer from retrospective jealousy. However have since discovered bf not shutting down advances from girls e.g., colleagues having a crush on him, and old crush sending him love songs on and off for three years straight. He brushed off these as them ‘fishing,’ assured me nothing is going on, deleting messages wouldn’t letting me read, and blaming things on my jealousy. He admitted liking them as ‘ego boosts’ and wouldn’t eventually shut it down until we have a huge fight. My trust is broken by my bf’s behaviour of deleting texts, not telling me after it was agreed upon, entertaining attention from this girl for years (he admitted they were ‘ego boosts’ for him), and lying to avoid a fight. 

Full example below: three years into our relationship, back in February this year, I saw a week-old text notification from the old crush on his phone, which he hadn’t responded to. When I confronted him, he wouldn’t show me the messages but explained that she had started sending love songs again. He said he had deleted the texts and initially hadn’t told me because he didn’t think it was a big deal and didn’t want to trigger my anxiety. I was hurt that he’s not shut her down completely given this is the third year of her doing this, and he promised to tell me &amp; block her if she ever messaged him again. Feeling uneasy, I decided to message her myself (with my bf knowing). She apologized and said they were just long-term friends and nothing more, and even offered to stop messaging if it made me uncomfortable. 

Later this year, however, I found out she had messaged him again. My boyfriend tried to cover it up by lying to ‘avoid a fight’, but it only made things worse. Eventually, he agreed to block her on all social media. I should’ve left it but ended up reaching out to her again for clarification, and she claimed my boyfriend had told her he was single. My boyfriend unblocked her to ask why she said that, and she admitted she lied out of anger and blamed me for questioning their friendship. Although the situation was eventually clarified, my trust was still shattered. 

My boyfriend has blocked her again now and agreed to keep his phone open to me, but I’m still heartbroken over this whole thing and struggling to rebuild the trust we once had. Any advice on how to move forward would be really appreciated!

How early is too early for burnout?,"I’m a Physiotherapist and I graduated 3 years ago. At first, the first 6 months were great, it was tough but rewarding. You really felt like you’d made it, you were now a contributing member of society, and whenever you mentioned you were a physiotherapist at a party, people would tell you about all their aches and pains, it wasn’t a bad life.



But then you start to realise the darker side of the health industry, the mental, physical, and emotional toll it takes on you. The long and late working hours. The bleak and stark reality that you wouldn’t realistically be able to increase your earning capacity, it will constantly be you trading your time for money, day in and day out for the next 40+ years. 



Your salary will go up with the consumer price index, and unless you were willing to fork out 40-80K, cut down your work hours and invest the next two years of your life completing a Masters that will just unload onto you more subjective written assignments, you weren’t really going to get a commission raise or pay rise. 



There are days you’re so tired, you get home and can’t even speak to your family because you’ve used up all your mental energy being cheerful with patients. There are days when you feel like you’ve absorbed all the sadness, pain and suffering your patients experience and unload onto you. Some days, random thoughts pop into your mind, “Hang on, did I send that letter for X?”. And don’t get me started on the compensable patients. 



I’ve hung on now for the past few years, it feels like a painful slog. Where you feel that every day, is another step deeper into the mire. You think to yourself, how much longer can I hold on. You listen to your colleagues at lunch, and they’re all struggling, inhaling their third coffee for the day. Complaining of their own aches and pains that they’ve ignored because of work. Never taking a sick day because you feel guilty for not seeing your patients or for not being sick enough. 



Then, life begs the question. Where do I go from here? I’ve invested 4 years of education and 50K of university debt to get this degree. I pay annual fees just to continue to practise, done thousands of dollars worth of mandatory personal development. I’ve invested another three years to clinical work. All I know and have are my physiotherapist skills. So, what can I do to survive in this increasingly financially demanding world? I’ll have to work like a slave and even then will be unable to afford a house. The more jobs and hours I work, the more I get taxed, so what’s the point in me trying so hard when at the end of it, there’s not much left over. So I ask myself, Is this really the life I want to live for the rest of my life?

Ignoring fist burnout signs was a mistake,"My biggest mistake was ignoring the first burnout signs. It was very easy to dismiss them as ""just being a little tired"" and telling myself it will pass.

I overworked myself and only led me to the point when I was anxious and tired all the time. I stopped caring for my hobbies and even something like watching movies or TV shows seemed like too much effort. Then no amount of rest was enough. It didn't seem like a big deal at first but when it didn't improve for months, I started to really worry.

Now, I'm trying to get better and recover. I started to prioritise my health and rest, spend more time with my friends and family and I decided to change my job. I'm still tired and stressed but hopeful.

Purchased a certified pre-owned vehicle and it already has problems in less than 24 hours,"I just purchased a certified pre owned used vehicle at a name brand dealership. Before I took off with the vehicle they told me the the car was inspected and ready to go. Not even five minutes into driving the car there was already a hand full of problems. I'm not sure what it's called but the bottom plastic shield underneath the car came off and started dragging on the ground and is now ruined because of the drag and rocks kicking up. There was also some small leaking and whenever I turned up the AC there would be a clicking/buzzing noise. The steering also feels really loose and floaty and it tends to want to turn to the right instead of staying straight. Also one of the brake/parking lights don't come on and some of the buttons in the car are really stiff. 

I'm planning to take the car back to the dealership and it's been less than 24 hours. What are my options here? Should I ask them if I can get another car instead of them fixing the issues?

Concerning marriage of a Christian and a non-Christian,"*Cry Samson and Delilah,*

*And we look at the Heathen with hate.*

*I am lucky to be a Hindu who believes in Jesus,*

*I get to see the Nations fighting with peace.*

*God has played divide and rule,*

*And who can overturn his will?*

*The Jews is good and the Gentile bad,*

*Is this the message of the Bible?*

Christians are no better than non-Christians. We are beggars telling other beggars where to find food, as a pastor said on an Internet sermon. And as inter-religious marriages are uncommon in all religions, as looking at matrimonial advertisements in the newspaper might tell you, so they are uncommon in Christians as well. People generally tend to marry in their own religion, and Christians are no exception.

And for a reason. Marriage is not just marriage between a man and a woman, but rather a marriage between two communities. You don’t want to intermarry with a bad community, do you? But seldom do people look at the faults of their own communities, if I might say.

But I want to know the absolute answer. Is marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian good?

Well, I believe any marriage must be preserved and there should be no divorces, first of all. So, if someone marries a person from another religion, the marriage is to be preserved.

But apart from that, I can tell you these things:

1. *The Book of Jonah* clears the dust from the eyes of the Jews (the Christians now), that people outside the Covenant are not bad. They are not your enemies, they are your friends. So marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian is fine.
2. Solomon’s bride was the then Pharaoh’s daughter. *Song of Songs* is an erotic literature of the love between a Jew and a non-Jew. And it is the only Love Story in the Wisdom Literature in the Bible.
3. *The Book of Ruth* tells the story of an outsider who married in and of whose lineage was born David. As Ruth herself said: ‘*your God will be my God.*’

But I claim to be no expert. As far as I am concerned, I will ask any prospective bride to tolerate my mental illness and a Jesus idol in the prayer space.",Christianity,1728645310,nonburnedout,nonburnedout
Why does religion always have to be one sided?,"I'm just wondering why does there have to be one religion? I feel like all it does is divide the people and cause more issues than it does good. Why can't we just openly get together and talk about what we experience as good and what we thing is best for society and personal life in general as a topic without bringing in a deity.... We will fight over the most irrelevant things that it blinds ""us"" all from the real topics that need to be discussed and keeps people from be oneing pure hearted individuals.

"Im burned out, what do I do?","When does burnout hit the breaking point when its not just an excuse for not doing school work? And how do I explain to my teachers and other people that Im not just lazy without having a doctors certificate for burnout, cuz he simply doesn't believe me! 

So Im 18yrs - 3rd year of art gymnasium in Europe (a difficult programm - like highschool), and have been burnout since I started. Ive realized that last year but noone would believe me - neither my parents, teacher or friends. No matter what I said they just brushed it off and simply said I was just being lazy - and that I should start putting in some effort. Somehow I manged to successfully finish the 2nd year anyway, but my burnout didn't go away in summer break - which here lasts abt two months. It didnt get better no matter how much I slept and no matter what I ate. And in 3rd year it got progressivly worse every two months. In december I started failing all of my exams (even tho I used to be a good student for whole middle and elementary schol) and no matter what I did I couldnt pass. I simply couldnt remember things, and my brainfog never went away aswell as dizziness and sleep problems - I couldn't wake up at all. But somehow through many unslept nights and way too many energy drinks I slowly fixed all of the exams I failed. I survived the rest of the school year studying for average of 10 hours a day and up to 6 cans of energy drinks a night. I still failed and fixed many exams, cuz there was just no other way to do it. Apart from that I struggled with other issues like UTIs and bladder problems, another of my two front teeth died which brought a lot of pain, a really bad caugh that lasted for a month and a half and a cold that didnt want to go away. Aswell I probably had broken my ribs on several spots and theyve been hurting for four months now but my doctor wont do anything. So due to all that I never had a chance to get better and due to not ever being able to miss a day or two of school due to being week and constant pain which I had no certificate for. And now Im here  and Im probably failing a year because my doctor said it just puberty and that its normal while talking to me like I was a ten yearold. I aswell cant do anything anymore -its gotten so bad that I barely sit, stand or walk for a longer period without getting extremly week and tired no matter how much I sleep. That made my learning process difficult - aswell as letters moving when I read (more than they used to, and no its not dysexia). How do I explain all of this to the teachers and other ppl who have no interest in understanding without  me having a certificate?",burnedout,1718065452,burnedout,burnedout

How to Most Efficiently Use Emergency Fund?,"Finally need to tap my emergency fund. I'm getting my engine replaced on my car for $4.5k. The general consensus is that it's worth it. 


I have about $12k in Ibonds, $8k in a HYSA (technically some of it it a pass through acct for my mortgage, so I pretend I only have $6k to keep a buffer), and a couple thousand in normal checking accounts.

It's cheaper if I pay the mechanic with cash, but I'd rather pay a 4% fee and have some credit card protection in place. 

I have some thoughts that involve a 0% balance transfer and then paying it off, so I keep my emergency fund and have a 0% on this. I'd likely stop investing  ($1.5k a month into a brokerage account) until the credit card is paid off. 

But I'd love to hear some more thoughts on how to optimize this not-so-great situation.

White collar life is silly but I don't see a way out,"Where to begin.

I'm in my 30s and have been really blessed to be so successful so young in my career. Some of it was hard work and sacrifice to rise quickly and have high performance while I realize some was being in the right place at the right time. I now make $300K+ a year, but I'm in such a HCOL area it leaves me comfortable but not rich enough to take extravagant vacations or own more than a modest townhome. I'm second in command of a nationally recognized firm.

Problem is that I play the game of the corporate world on the outside but I'm somewhat on the spectrum and also just really practical and was raised in the country, so it's all just bullshit to me like a game we play that happens to generate a very awesome paycheck. I often wonder if anyone will ever realize our industry is not a real job. 

I've started feeling so jaded about the corporate world, meetings, documents, technology, everything I just don't fucking care. I want to wake up every day and go hiking, lift weights, run through a beautiful park, cook amazing meals for my kids, cruise town on my motorcycle, and read books by the campfire or in a kayak floating down the river. 

Seriously I spend like 75% of my day daydreaming trying to figure out how I can maintain my life and pay my mortgage while being more active and outdoors more and just enjoying the planet and not dreading staring at Teams longer. My brain feels broken and I guess maybe it's a form of burnout. My job isn't especially hard or stressful, I don't work long hours because fuck that nobody ever died wishing they'd done more than the bare minimum for soulless companies, and I just never find the solution. 

I'm a hard worker. I'm smart. I've got years of perfect performance reviews and promotions to show for it. And I don't give a shit about any of it, I wish I could keep my salary but trade for a job selling plants or giving river tours or something.",burnedout,1713924055,burnedout,burnedout

But in Psalm 69, David outlines that God does not turn away from those who are in prison. God knows how difficult it is for us to navigate this earth, with our flesh and spirit constantly fighting against each other. But He will never leave nor forsake you, as He promised:

Telling a Story Through Social Media,"The only post I found on this topic is 11 years old, so I thought I'd create a new one. 

For a while now, I’ve been exploring different ways to tell a story beyond traditional books, and given the digital age we live in, I started wondering—why not use social media?

My biggest inspiration for this idea comes from *Cytus 2*, a mobile rhythm game set in a fictional world. In the game, the main characters interact on a fictional social media platform, and as you play, more of the story gets revealed.

My concept is to create a fictional social media experience that readers have to navigate through. The story would be highly nonlinear, allowing readers to piece it together on their own.

Has anyone done something similar to this before?

Considering that social media today is dominated by short videos, do you think a version using only text, images, and possibly audio would still be engaging enough in 2024?

I’m also debating whether to make all content available from the start, or to have it gradually unfold as the reader progresses through the story. What are your thoughts on each approach?",writing,1728593065,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

"Balancing Work, Dreams, and Burnout – Losing Motivation to Chase My Passion","I'm not sure if this is the right reddit for me or not.  Hope it is.



I'm a full-time employee, and my job pays me well (all bills are paid, and food is on my table). I still don't have my own home (rental). And I'm not trying to complain about the workload, even though I would like to because it's too much to handle. However, I must admit I'm blessed for being employed.  



I just started doing my master's (EMBA), first semester.  Assignments are kind of long but that's fine.  



In 2020, I found out that I love telling stories and making games (game development).  I even published a game on a well known website for PC games in 2021.  It didn't make me money, but I feel proud that I achieved that.



I had so much hope that one day I would become a full-time game developer but with my full-time job, but lately I don't have that energy to work on anything once I'm home.  I work from 7:30 AM till 4:30 PM; very often till 6 PM.  And even when I get home I have things to do for work.  So, I cannot just leave my work back at the office, I take it home with me.



Nowadays, I'm always tired and down and I started questioning about my dream of being a full-time game developer.  Even my PC that I built for this purpose only, now being used for work.  I even started telling myself that eventually, we will all die, so why bother following such dreams? But I get more depressed when this part of my brain starts talking this way.



I tried organizing my days but even when with that I ended up going home so tired after fighting at work and fell asleep on the coach.  



It's not that I don't have the time, it's that I don't have the energy to do anything.  I'm not even working out like I used to and it took it's toll on my weight.  I cannot lose weight not matter what.



I was diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality, borderline type.  But I'm unsure if this has something to do with my current emotional situation.



Even while typing this reddit post, I feel overwhelmed because I've never been able to talk my head out.

"Low effort and forgetful partner... What can I do about all of it? Me (F19) and my boyfriend (M23)
","I don’t have anyone to talk to this about so hoping that a kind stranger will listen to my struggles. We live about 3 hours away by car from each other, we have been together since March 2024 and we see each other once or twice per month and we try to call every day at the end of the day. There are many issues in different aspects of the relationship, here they are:

1.      I am always the one asking to call at the end of the day. I am always the one asking how he is feeling, how his day is going, etc. Sometimes he doesn’t even ask me the question back and it leads to me having to carry the conversation (on text) all the time. We talked about it and he said he just hates texting and I get it I prefer calling as well but it’s not difficult to simply check up on your partner with a quick text. He also forgets important stuff sometimes and it scares me. Last month (we have been together for 6 months) he asked me how old I was... he forgot my age. I don’t take it personal but what the fuck?

2.      I feel like I am always the one doing all of the planning, finding all of the activities for us to do together. I’m always the one going to visit him (almost 3 hours away by car). He came to my town once this summer. I find it better for me to go visit him anyways because he lives in his apartment and I still live with my family but it’s just the fact that he doesn’t make an effort to plan something or tells me like ‘we should / could see each on this date, etc.’ it’s always me.

3.      He rarely sends me photos of him. I told him that seeing his face cheers me up and he said he would try to send me more pictures but he rarely does it. Maybe 1 picture per month. However, he has no issues posting pictures on his insta. I send him photos of me regularly and if I will post something I always show him the pictures first. I also consistently make an effort to provide him with spicy content because I want to be to able to fulfill that need of his even when I am not around since we see each other once or twice a month. The problem is that he rarely sends me anything in return, it is not something I expect but I would sure appreciate it.

4.      He said he is not comfortable taking photos and videos of himself naked and I understand that but he has sent me some in the past without any issues, we made videos together, etc. He is the first guy that I’ve talked to that doesn’t really want to sext and I’m not sure how to feel about it because I personally love it.

5.      Sometimes, I explain my feelings towards something he has done or didn’t do and he lashes out on me. He takes it personal. On the moment he gets so heated up and cannot control his reactions. I never insult him, I never use curse words, (he doesn’t either) I only use ‘I’ statements to express myself, I don’t put the blame on him, so why does he react like this? I even explained this exact situation to him and told him it makes me scared to talk to him about how I feel certain times and he lashed out again. I just don’t get it.

6.      Sometimes he has really bad mood swings during the day when we are together in person. He becomes unpleasant out of nowhere and I have a really hard time understanding what is causing it. We have talked about it and he also apologizes when that happens before I leave to go back home and I always tell him I just wish I could understand what is causing it so I could help him improve those mood swings.

The majority of our time spent together in person is great and I enjoy every moment of it. We have similar values and goals for the future. We know what we want and we have made it clear to each other. I love him deeply for who he is and who he is working towards becoming.

I know it takes time to change and if we zoom out we haven’t been together for a very very long time yet so, what else could I do about all of this?

**TLDR:** I’m mostly the one initiating communication, planning our meetups, and putting in effort to stay connected, but my boyfriend doesn’t really reciprocate the same way. He forgets important things, like my age, and rarely shares photos, despite me asking. While he doesn’t feel comfortable with sexting, which I understand, I still feel disappointed. He sometimes lashes out when I express my feelings, making it hard for me to communicate openly. He also has unpredictable mood swings. Despite all this, I love him deeply, and our time together in person is mostly great, but I’m unsure how to handle these issues.",relationships,1728566901,nonburnedout,burnedout
"Youth Savings Suggestions for 14, 10, 6 year old","I currently have 529 plans for all of my kids, but also Capital One youth savings account for each that we deposit money into every chance we are able to. The downside to these savings accounts is that, the interest is less than 1% - it's ridiculous to keep any money in there. 

  
I've been researching opening a Youth brokerage account at Fidelity, or UTMA, and then it dawned on me... why can't i just open 3 separate HYSA's at a bank with a strong rate (I have MyBankingDirect/Flagstar, i think it's at 5.15% but i opened it at 5.35%), deposit the money into those accounts and then when the kids turn 18, gift it back to them.  We can simultaneously do brokerage accounts with the small amounts they earn doing odd jobs at their Grandpa's shop (well, not the 6 yo just yet...or...can he?). But, i feel like they would get just as good a financial education watching money grow at a good rate as opposed to a measly .3% (or other junky) rate.  If they watch their money grow healthily, that (In my mind) would be more of an incentive to put money in places where it will work for them at a young age.

  
Am I off my rocker here? I'm 42 and unfortunately went into economic-education panic in the last few years realizing that my eldest, my daughter, will be looking at colleges soon enough.

Partner doesn’t initiate sex,"TL;DR 26F &amp; 30F - partner doesn’t initiate sex even after being asked to countless times

My partner and I have been together for 6 years. She’s never had much confidence in herself so I would mostly initiate sex. Earlier on in the relationship she would too. Anyway, I started communicating that I need her to initiate sex too as it makes me feel like shit and not sexy. Every conversation we’ve had about it, it’s been “yep okay I’ll make more effort” and nothing changes. We’ve had this conversation maybe 8/9x in the last 18 months. 

Guess what… nothings changed. She doesn’t pursue me, doesn’t try and turn me on before she goes down on me. She just will say “oh do you want something” and then if I say yes, will just start eating me out.. no build up. I broke down to her, cried and told her how upset I was that I was telling her again and again and nothings changing. I thought that convo would be it. I made sure she knew how it was making me feel… thinking she was going to maybe kiss my neck for the first time in 3yrs. 

But nothings changed…. Again. It’s been 2 months since our last conversation and I’m at breaking point. There’s no point in having another conversation with her coz it’s pointless. I’ve started matching her energy, not touching her really coz she never touches me. She thinks I’m being off with her!!!! Which is so ironic. The thing is, I’ve always been more sexually charged than she has and anyone in a dating situation like this.. knows it sucks. She doesn’t know what it’s like to be rejected coz whenever she wants sex, I’m down. But I’m feeling so low about it all that I don’t plan on having sex with her for a long time. 

It’s hard because we’re getting married next year and everything else in our relationship is solid. We don’t argue, we communicate well (apparently most of the time)

I feel like for context, we’re lesbians and the only time she’ll try it on with me is when she wants me to fuck her. She’ll never try and fuck me. 

What do I do? Do I have another conversation with her? Do I just stop having sex with her until she wants to address it? Has anyone else been through it?",relationships,1728557639,nonburnedout,burnedout

Thoughts on Potential Teachers New to Teaching,"I’m sorry if my title is confusing I really don’t know exactly for sure how to ask this question or, but I have had a few(3) people reach out to me in the last month they keep hearing about the teacher shortage and they’re wondering if it would be a good idea for them to “try” teaching.

I’m a social studies teacher, and the nephew of a friend contacted me because he’s finishing his bachelors in history and thinks he wants to go into teaching but hasn’t taken any education classes.  

Another person that I worked with a long time ago in a job outside of teaching retired early and was actually asked by local superintendent if they’d be interested in an emergency hire for an open position as a business teacher though they’re not certified.

Finally, a woman at our church who used to own her own daycare and is now working as an LTA in an elementary school wants to go back to school to get her teaching certificate.

One of the questions that they all ask in more words or less was “Is teaching a good job?”  On any given day, I have a million different answers to this question, but I don’t want to be the one who encourages someone who goes into it but doesn’t end up liking it.  Or to dissuade someone who might really like it.

What answer would you all give if asked?",teaching,1728610725,nonburnedout,nonburnedout
Burned out writing my thesis. Should I try medications ?,"Hello there.

I feel mentally blurred at the moment.

I’m in dental school for the second time (in order to validate my degree in a new country). After almost 12 years of medical studies, this is starting to take a toll on me. My mental and intellectual capacities are playing out. Every little task seems impossible, and I see absolutely blank when I look at my thesis.

I have lived under a lot of pressure, especially the last 4 years, and I have so far been able to keep up with it, but now as I approach the end and I’m writing my research thesis, I seem no longer to be able to force myself to be productive.

I have no energy left. 

I feel depleted mentally and drained emotionally. Some close friends told me I might be suffering from mental burnout, and I think they might be right. 

The problem is that I need to finish my thesis as soon as possible in order to avoid financial issues that I am already struggling with. To sum it up, I’ll be in debt as well as in deeper trouble if I don’t finish it before the next term. I don't have backups to that problematic. 

My question is, has anyone here seen a doctor for this kind of problem ? Or has been prescribed some kind of medication for it? I need a boost to regain my will to push forward. 

I only need this extra push—1 or 2 months of at least some motivation (that I obviously am not able to provide by myself at the moment)—to go forward that last mile, and I’ll be done.  Then finally, I hope to give myself some well-deserved rest and self-care. 

Please, no judgements. And yes, I know in theory what I need to do to get things done, I have been doing this for a looong time, health studies are no joke 😭but I am simply incapable at the moment of making myself do those things again.

I’m trying to be objective here, but the truth is... I've never been on meds for mental health issues, so naturally, I’m a bit worried. 

Thank you all in advance for your input. ",burnedout,1719091227,burnedout,burnedout
"I think I just ended a relationship with a narcissist, but I realised too late. We work together, how to manoeuvre myself in the situation from here? ","Hi, as title says. I want to preface this by saying that I am not fully innocent in this situation and I am already aware of that which is partially why I decided to make decisions to end things. I know I am not a perfect person in this situation and I am grappling with those thoughts already, but I genuinely need some advice on what to do because I can’t speak with anyone in my personal life about this situation.

I (21f) entered a relationship with K (39m) approximately 10 months ago. He is a colleague in my workplace who is not directly in my chain of management but is several positions higher than me. When I was fresh to the workplace he made some small efforts to chat to me and one day very randomly hugged me (which is no big deal to me im very friendly and I hug people often). I will point out I am fairly oblivious when people show interest in me because im neurodivergent and not always aware socially at times especially when people show attraction or romantic interest. He offered to drive me home at night because we lived in the same direction and we got a bit closer by sharing about our lives. After a few of these rides home he kissed me. 

It was not until a few nights later that he told me he actually has a daughter and is married. Over the whole course of our relationship I tried to understand more about his marriage and why he would stray, and he of course put blame on her but honestly nothing major or very serious. It was awkward to ask about and usually he tried to change the subject but I did get some information from him. He expressed he wanted to separate but then they found out they were expecting their daughter and decided to stay together. He expressed his dissatisfaction of his relationship with her but felt obligated to stay because of their daughter and the fact he is the only one working. He moved to this country for his career and his wife agreed to follow but never became immersed in the new environment. She does not speak english and because of this feels it would be too difficult for her to work in the same industry she previously worked in when living in her country. Obviously I hear all of this through K’s lens, which I should not fully trust, but he does not necessarily have reason to lie about some things. Even when he told me quite negatively about his marriage I still felt I could empathise with them both. I don’t consider myself a saint, perhaps if I was then maybe I would have cut it off sooner and told her about this, but given his wife’s circumstances I feel she would be unable to leave him anyway and if she tried she could potentially put herself in a really unsavoury position. I mention some of this to highlight cultural difference and also again there is a large age gap hence me and K are in different life stages. 

I felt when K told me about his situation that it was not my responsibility to tell him what is and is not “right” and maybe selfishly I just enjoyed being wanted by someone and since I had no personal hindrances I just let things continue. Our relationship eventually grew and became sexual and this was when K told me that he was in love with me. I was very hesitant to let him sleep with me even though sex itself is not a big hang up for me, but he was very adamant and eventually as time passed I agreed. 

Honestly, im a little emotionally weak, so when he expressed his deeper feelings for me he had me hooked. Over time I learnt that K has some jealousy issues and some anger management issues. He has quite narrow perspective and was unable to understand how I could interact with males at work and keep things professional while being friendly. He felt my friendliness was “too much” and often got upset with me for even just speaking to others. These men he was jealous of were both staff and customers. I often did not attend group work outings and social events to ensure he was still happy and not upset with me. Yes I did always see how his view was contradictory considering he has a wife but the thing about myself in relationships like this is even if I can notice something unfair, I am easy to walk over and will usually just do as I am told by people to make them happy. 

He expressed that when I was upset or sad or frustrated it annoyed him and he just wanted me to be happy around him and not ruin his mood or our time together. He did not hold himself to the same standard and often spoke with me about his own issues or grievances. Most of his focus on our relationship was sexual. Almost every conversation he would mention something sexual, wanting to sleep with me etc. Even if our conversation topic was completely unrelated. It was flattering but at times very exhausting because it was honestly not the only thing I cared about and I had many other things about our relationship that I thought about and wanted. It felt like if I didn’t give him what he wanted he was disappointed in me, which was truly the most excruciating feeling, and so I did what he asked of me. In return he gave me the affection I craved and obviously filled some emotional satisfaction in the way that he definitely was mending some paternal issues I have (which I feel is obvious given the age difference). 

Anyways, to the situation at hand: essentially some coworkers invited me to the beach and I decided to go. I have been trying to cultivate good friendships and not isolate myself anymore. K decided that this was absolutely not okay because 2 colleagues he was particularly jealous about were attending. In no way have these men ever expressed anything other than general friendliness to me, and really have never crossed any line with me at work ever. We also do not speak outside of work so are not close- I went to spend time with one girl I work with in particular who I would like to be better friends with. K was incredibly angry that I was going, and no matter how much I tried to reassure him he had decided that this meant we could not be together since I was being “disrespectful”. I did not allow the conversation to continue much because I did not want to stress myself more than necessary, but this was the first time we argued and I decided I wouldn’t just grovel and do what he wanted. I was already frustrated for something he had done at work (unrelated to me) and was questioning his character after becoming aware of what happened. This argument for me was like the final straw and I ended up expressing we shouldn’t keep arguing while upset. Handling the situation in this manner felt like a big deal for me, as usually I am always on “urgent damage control” and am easy to push around just so that I can calm the other person down-even if it means letting go of my own feelings in the moment. Since I was already feeling upset and a bit disappointed in his behaviour, I think I was able to stand up for myself more in the situation. 

The following evening he sent me a message that read “You do this because you really want to make me mad? Ok I will show you I will do. You will regret” I believe this was in reference to a picture I had posted that I actually took down shortly after because i didn’t really like how I looked. The picture showed some of my body but I wasn’t like fully nude or anything like that. He often was upset at me posting anything of myself, as he was always very protective of me and did not like other people to see me in any way that could deem me “attractive” or “sexy”. K has never really spoken to me like this before, but it caused immense anxiety and I actually had an anxiety attack thinking about the whole thing.

Yesterday I returned to work and ultimately tried to avoid him, but he is in a position where at times I am forced to speak with him. When I did have to ask him something, he was ultimately non communicative and very rude to me. He even refused to help me with a customer simply due to how he is obviously mad at me. After our interaction I went to the bathroom to cry because I am unable to handle interactions like this, and the behaviour is very reminiscent of my father and ex boyfriend (both of whom are narcissistic). 

I have done a lot of reading in my life about emotional intelligence, different behavioural and psychological issues, and general things about relationships. In my life I am often vulnerable because I am socially behind (again, neurodivergent) so I make effort to keep myself knowledgeable on how to interact with others and how to identify possibly negative behaviours that I may otherwise miss in my life. 

The reason that I note K is narcissistic is because (upon reflection) I can identify many situations and circumstances in which he displays behaviour aligned with narcissistic tendencies. K is unable to regulate his emotions and typically discusses unsavoury situations where he is “innocent” or the “victim”, even when it is clear that perhaps blame could be shared. He often attempted to control my actions and words by commenting on who I was with, what I wore and getting incredibly upset when I was not quick to agree. He seemed to sympathise with me at times but never expressed deep understanding of what I told him about myself, which suggests that he may have a poor ability to empathise with other people. He is quite stubborn and prideful and unable to take any criticism without retaliation. Many times in disagreements he shut me down and refused to let me talk, often mentioning that he will simply leave without discussion even though I made it clear that such a thing would upset me greatly. Conversely, he made a point to drive me home every single day and if I did not go with him he encouraged me to uber to ensure I was going directly home and safely (though I believe his actual intention was to ensure I did not seeing other people.) He also would call me every morning on his commute to work and call me after he took me home, which felt sweet at the time, but if I ever expressed wanting or needing to do something else he would become slightly agitated and ask many many questions. He asked every day if I still love him or miss him or want him, which initially was sweet because I thought it was him being vulnerable but given how excessive it was I can see it for something not so sweet and perhaps a tactic to keep me reeled in emotionally. Obviously I am not a psychologist but I am also not completely stupid so think identifying and mentioning these things is important for context on how K generally behaves and reacts.

Nobody in the workplace is aware of our relationship, in fact many people don’t even realise we are friendly outside of work let alone in a relationship. This was purposeful as people are aware of his daughter and wife and he made a point to be quite secretive about our relationship. 

I would be lying if I said I didn’t love him, because part of me still does. But I did know that the end of our relationship was inevitable, I just didn’t expect it to happen right now. I have often found myself in the trap of being with narcissist people in my life and I often don’t realise until too late. I understand that in this situation I was the vulnerable one, and the way he treated me at the beginning could be considered grooming in some form. But I am still an adult and need to take on some responsibility also for this situation, I am not completely free of blame I know. Because of my self awareness of not being “innocent” so to speak, I feel I cannot go to anyone for help or advice. 

I spoke briefly and without much context with one person who advised me to see HR, but the issue is that actually there has been quite a few big HR issues that I was a witness to. I don’t want this situation to discredit anything I said in separate incidents, because I feel very strongly I needed to stick up for people who were being mistreated. K was also in part related to these other issues, but not at all to myself. Honestly it feels like a big mess but I am stubborn and don’t want to just quit. Threatening me was not a very wise decision, and I do have evidence even though he tried to delete it. Given he is above me in the company he is not in the best position to be talking to me in such ways. 

I know that further engaging in conversation with him will just escalate the situation, but given the fact he threatened me I feel I can’t sit by and do nothing. I worry my job may be in jeopardy, but also given I am a lower position in a corporate view point I would not be “responsible” in the same way that K is in the situation. 

If anyone has advice on how to handle this situation, even just advice on how to attempt to work alongside him, I would appreciate it. I am looking for a new therapist closer to my home because I can see how this cycle of relationships like this is damaging to me but am still waiting for an appointment. So in the meantime, reddit was my only option. Sorry if this was long and confusing, I am a bit of a mess. I am posting here instead of in r/breakups because we still have a working relationship as colleagues right now.

---

Hi, I'm currently working in retail and have just come back to work from medical leave for severe burnout from working full-time in a toxic environment.

 I'm now working in the same place in a different role at part time, but the hours are not enough to live on so I'm trying to find more work. My problem is that I don't just want to keep up this cycle of finding a minimum wage job that I have to overwork myself in just to pay the bills, but isn't good for my mental health. 

A lot of the people in my life have suggested some sort of data entry job or call center job until I'm able to save up to go back to school and do upgrading (so I can eventually go into a program at university), but until then I need to find a job that I can work hard in and will see the effort I put into my job- unfortunately all the retail/food industry jobs I've had have been very clique-y and unprofessional.

I'm a very hard worker and I'm extremely intuitive and have great ideas, but unfortunately I have severe adhd and can't control how much I talk a lot of the time- which is why I'm in retail right now. I'm also asd and struggle with being a doormat when it comes to people in positions of power over me, so I end up getting treated really badly by my bosses. 

I just want a job where I can put my head down, work hard and not feel like I'm the weird kid in school again. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant.

Thanks for any advice.

Got a raise and now take home is less??? How can I maximise take-home?,"Hi everyone, I never thought this would happen but recently I moved positions and now earn a few hundred more on my monthly salary. However, when leaving my last job they gave me a 3500£ redundancy payout which I thought was great. However, this seems to have triggered something that annulled my Marriage allowance (wife is on maternity leave and so I thought this was a good idea to take a bit of her allowance as she earns next to nothing and we cannot afford childcare in London). 

Anyways it seems that I now owe HMRC more money and they are prorating it over the next year or so. Leaving me with less take-home pay than my earlier job. What can I do to actually take home more pay for earning more money - instead of less money? Can I over-contribute to my pension or something like that to allow me to re-trigger the marriage allowance? I was not even aware there was an upper limit on that benefit. Can I claim some of this work travel tax back to reduce my tax burden? Donate? I don't know.

I want to be religious but I cant. What am I missing?,"(Already posted this on a different sub, hoping to get more specific answers here)


My family is christian. My moms side is very religious and they used to drag me to church very often and I hated it. But nowadays Ive had a deep longing for meaning. 

The world seems very very bleak to me and I struggle so hard everyday. It feels Im living a sick joke and  im just living for the little crumbs that life throws at me. The rest is just fighting and fighting and fighting... im tired.

 I do have my lovely girlfriend ive been with for 2 years. She isnt exactly the most stable mentally either but she is christian and a strong believer. It seems to give her something that i dont have. Ever since I've met her, ive been thinking about God a lot. But I cant convince myself that he exists. You know, the old thing that atheists always say: ""if there is a god then why does bad shit happen to good people"" yadayada yada. But really. I mean, this example is not related to me, but.. Unit 731.. if you know about it, then you know.

The things that happened there to presumably mostly innocent people, is beyond cruel. All these people did was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And their end was a death so unimaginably cruel and demonic, that it was able to just shatter my belief in any salvation.

We are just here, playing the hunger games or something. A product of probability. The outcome doesnt matter, as long as it works. Stuff like this can and will happen again. To innocent people. 

Now, christianity has hell. But that doesnt matter. These people still went through all of that suffering. Doesnt matter if the bad guys burn in hell for all of eternity. I dont give a fuck. I just dont want this stuff to happen. 

These things are, to me, evidence that life and the universe is completely devoid of a higher purpose. And things like free will. Yea, its a controversial topic, but it seems that we are made up of particles and the interaction between particles make up our actions etc. This is proven, I believe. So, why should we believe that we can control our actions, when particles probably dont have free will either? So the whole concept of heaven or hell doesnt make sense to me either. 

Im not trying to bash christianity. I know christian people are humans just like me. You think similar things and go through similar things that i do. So, what am I missing? Maybe there is some key thing that could make me understand.

 Ive asked my girlfriend about it, but she has difficulty articulating it. Maybe its because she has been a believer since a child.

I (F22) Feel Like My BF (M27) Expects All My Attention – How Do I Balance My Own Needs?,"We had a fight today because he told me that when we were together in the house (where we live together), I’m always on my phone. 

I’m really struggling to balance my personal life and couple life with him throughout these 4 years of our relationship. He doesn’t really have a schedule or goals in life, he just heads to work everyday and that’s it. I’m the complete opposite- I had goals since I was a kid and I’m really working towards my professional goals and dreams that require a lot of effort. I’ve been noticing that whenever I’m trying to do something for myself, he gets frustrated. Most of the time that happens when I make plans to see other people. He doesn’t do that, so whenever I’m planning to he then tries to make plans with his friends too, but never on his own schedule and pace. 

Today he brought up again that when we were at home together I’m always on my phone. It’s not a new complaint and I really tried to not do that and do more things together while at home, but I’ve noticed that in reality it’s the only time I have some time for myself and I don’t want to give that up. I also feel it’s kinda unfair- today he came home from work at around 9:30 pm, and we decided to stay at home because I was feeling unwell tonight. I told him to go out with his friends but he didn’t want to so he stayed with me. We decided to watch a movie together which lasted 2 hours , and then we were sleepy so we were going to bed. It was a lazy day when he came home, it’s true. But yesterday when he got off from work in the afternoon, we went shopping because he wanted to buy new clothes, we then grabbed a coffee, strolled around the city, and then went to a restaurant. We were out for about 6 hours and I had a really good time. And this happens almost daily, we always go for a walk and most of the times we go out for a drink or dinner. 

I really feel stress in this whole situation and it seems unfair to me that he’s always looking for reasons to say I’m not giving him attention. Looking at the bigger picture, I feel like I don’t have enough time for myself and when I do, I feel guilty subconsciously because of his attitude. How can we balance this out? What can I do to understand him more and for him to understand me better? Any advice is appreciated.

Told wife the holy spirit convicted me against santa and the easter bunny. ,My wife says she believes in god. I told her the holy spirit convicted me against the above stated fake beings and she said I'm nuts.. it turned out about as well as I expected it to but it had to be done per holy spirit. The conviction randomly came to me while I was driving to work. I've always enjoyed celebrating Christmas and Easter so this isn't something I've thought of going against before. Over the last 9 months or so I've really been getting close to and seeking god. Really feel like I've changed considerably like a new creation in god new heart and everything. I tested the conviction and it lines up with what I think god would want from me. Considering santa and the easter bunny overshadow Christ's celebration of birth and his resurrection.

Company taxed me on a mistake they made,"Just a preface I am not super knowledgeable when it comes to how taxes work.

My company took off $60 from my paycheck a few months back because I had left the money bag in my desk and it was short $60.  I put the money back in myself and had my manage verify it and I was under the impression everything was good.  Apparently someone decided that it would need to be deducted from my next paycheck and now that I made them aware of it, they taxed the $60 they owed me and now it's a few dollars less.  Its not about the money but the principal and from what I understand they shouldn't have taxed it.  Can anybody help clarify this for me?

Things have progressed fairly slowly, which i appreciate. We both clarified we do not like hook-ups and are looking for relationships. We recently started having sex so I wanted to check-in to see how he's feeling. We both confirmed we aren't having sex with others and that we like each other. However, there was no mention of getting off of the dating apps or if we're talking to other people. He told me he doesn't want to rush into putting labels onto anything. I understand, I don't want to rush into a relationship either, but hearing this made me feel like I may be a placeholder until he finds someone else, especially if he is still matching with people on the apps. 

So, an hour after this, I told him I needed time to process the conversation and think about if we want the same things. He was confused.I told him I don't want to rush into a relationship either, but I also am in between deciding to date someone for awhile exclusively or commitment/some form of labels.  I also told him I don't want to be a placeholder. He apologized and said this isn't what he meant. I also apologized and told him I understood, I just heard it that way.

Reassurance that burnout leave is the right thing to do,"Reassurance that burnout leave is the right thing to do

I have suffered with anxiety since I was a child. In addition, I have chronic depression and OCD. I've been in therapy and have been taking medications for half a decade straight at this point. I have been suffering with intense work anxiety for the past two years. I have had sick leave in the past which has helped temporarily, but I fear right now I am too far gone. Everyone recommends burnout leave for a substantial amount of time, and honestly, just the thought of it calms my mind. 

I like my job, and I am good at it. I've progressed quickly and am in a position I never thought I would be in a million years. I would like nothing more than to just...go to work and get on with things as a normal person. Right now, I am a complete mess. I am constantly tired, irritable, have decision paralysis in every aspect of my life, over consume weed to try to take my mind off things. I have mild suicidal thoughts, my work is suffering, I have no interests and I am indifferent to everything -  I tick all the burn out boxes.

My concern is work - we are extremely understaffed at a time with several huge projects. I am responsible for all of them, and with me gone it's very likely almost all of these will come to a halt. Everyone I talk to says my work will figure things but realistically I know it's not the case. With me gone it's just two junior members of the team who definitely can't handle all the responsibility. The guilt at the thought of sick leave is insurmountable at times. I feel like an awfully lazy and terrible person, like I should just persevere and get on with things, but I know rationally I am not making this up and am in need of help. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and taken the burnout leave they need? It would be great to hear some from folk who have been in a similar position.",burnedout,1726053972,burnedout,burnedout
Should I roll over my 401(k) to Roth IRA?,"Posted on a different sub but wanted more feedback. So I’ve just received a new job offer and I’m going to take it, but I still have my Roth 401(k) plan with my current employer and obviously I’m going to move it somewhere else but I’m not sure if I should allocate it to a Roth IRA or into my new employer’s 401(k) plan. 

I know rolling it over to my new employer’s plan is the easiest option, but since the offer was recent (haven’t even given 2 weeks notice yet) all I know is the company matches up to 6% of my contribution. 

I also know moving it to a Roth IRA gives me more autonomy and possibly lower fees, but I don’t have the funds to cover the initial tax to put into a Roth IRA and I’m not sure when I will be able to. Should I just wait until I can cover the tax even if it might be awhile before I can? Just go with company 401k? If you get a Roth IRA do you just opt out of your company’s 401k plan?

How do I (32m) explain to my partner (32m) that him putting his needs first is damaging our relationship?,"I've been in a relationship with my partner (Z) for about eight months now and this has been a continued issue for about half of our relationship. We are both disabled but in different aspects, so we usually fill in the others gaps to keep the house running, but I also have support services to help me (and by extension him) out 4-5 days/week, mainly with domestic help. For specifics that are relevant to this post, we both have ASD, ADHD, C-PTSD and I have fibromyalgia, POTS and several co-morbidities that affects my movement, co-ordination and strength.

The main issue is that he constantly puts his needs above my own and I'm constantly picking up the pieces. He constantly puts off important things like cleaning, he never cooks (which I knew from day one and was find about as long as he did the dishes on the days I don't get support work to help me) and if I ask him to do something for me, its always put off until the very last second.

Everything has been exasperated because I've recently gotten a service dog to help with my disabilities, which has caused me to rearrange my entire lifestyle to be able to take care of him. I told my partner that I needed him to step up, stop being selfish (his wording that I agreed with, not mine) and to actually help out when I need it instead of spending all day on the computer or reading.

Today, I had plans to do one of my hobbies as I haven't been able to do it for months now (prior to dating Z) and I've finally gotten the equipment I need. I asked him yesterday to clear out the kitchen for me as it's one of my chores I can't complete. I woke up this morning and he was gone to ""find a tree"" and that he'd be back soon. That was 5 hours ago now, and the kitchen still isn't done and I soon have to get started on dinner so I won't be able to do the baking I wanted to do. He also asked me to do a bunch of chores before he left, even though he hasn't done his.

This isn't the first time this has happened, he has forgotten promises like taking care of the dog so I could have a break (currently introducing him to our other animals and I dont trust leaving them alone just get), putting clothes away, organising the living room of his stuff, bringing washing in etc. On my birthday, he spent most of it locked in the study getting drunk with a friend and didn't understand why I got upset over it, nor why I still am.

I honestly feel more like a mother and a maid to him than a partner. We've had the same conversation multiple times, and nothing seems to change. It's making me begin regret starting up a relationship with him, especially when he prioritises his hobbies, happiness and time with friends over promises he's made me. He's told me outright he's abused partners in the past but has improved his behaviour (which I have seen), and this is my first relationship, so I'm uncertain if I'm seeing red flags or not. 

I want to have another discussion with him about how his actions are hurting me and our relationship but I honestly don't know where to begin or if this is even worth saving. How do I go about holding a conversation about this without letting my bitterness of previous actions that he's apologised for jade it?

TL;DR: My partner hasn't been completing tasks as promised, leaving me to pick up the slack. We are both disabled, me more so, and no matter how many times I ask, he won't pick up the slack. How do I go about holding a serious conversation with him about how this is damaging our relationship?",relationships,1728536812,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

My bane is config files. I can never tell if they are working or not. If you mistype one character it won’t work, but it won’t tell you, and you can’t know if the it’s the config or your code that isn’t working.

I can manage with good docs, but there’s a lot of bad ones out there. I feel like there’s a mysterious set of insider knowledge that BE devs have that I don’t that would unlock this whole mysterious world for me.

Self sabotaging or is it not working?,"I 24F have been with my partner 28M for nearly 2 years. We moved in together 6 months ago and share a dog (mostly mine).

i live with my parents so i can't invite him over often as it's a bit uncomfortable, and he has his own place living with cousins but we come from completely different cultures. his cousins know he has a girlfriend but me going to his place while his cousins are there would be a no. 

he was a student and at the start of the relationship i thought that once he finished his studies we would have more time together and he even said so himself, but nothing has changed since his graduation. he is working hard to quickly pay off his student loans and also trying to find a job with his degree so i don't want to sound selfish demanding time from him. 

in general he is a great guy who is very kind, sweet and generous, and so i don't want to throw a spanner in the works early while he is working hard to move up in life. and my life is quite boring at the moment so i just wonder if me doing this will come across as i have nothing else to do with my time but think about him.

I (17F) am unsure if I should break up with my (17M) boyfriend ,"I've been dating Mike for about 3 months, and I really like him, but everyone around me dislikes him. We started our relationship while I was getting to know someone else. He messaged me on Instagram every day, even after I set boundaries. He sent me a selfie and asked if I was a racist (we're of different races). When it was my birthday he didn’t even wish me happy birthday 

The first time we met, he wanted me to watch his game, but I had other plans, he begged me to come and to see me after. I invited him to a friend's house where we were making pizza and watching a movie. After his game, a girl jumped on him (she had her arms around his neck and his legs around his waist), and he said she was his cousin,(that was not his cousin) he asked me to meet him by the school hall and left me waiting on him from almost half an hour. Later, he came to the house, was rude to my friends, refused to talk to my friends, shushed my bsf and made a comment about one of my other friend not wearing a bra.

We always get into arguments when it comes to girls and his habit of lying and during our arguments he always mentions that he left another girl he was talking to for me. For example I made I joke about him always being the first person to like a girls photo and he went nuts and accused me of being jealous and when I asked him not to let girls like jump at the his final game he flipped and again and then I said I wasn't coming. 

I came anyways he ignored me the whole time, and when he finally came to talk to me, he just asked if I was going now because he was and then he walked away. I tried opening up to him about feeling ignored that day and that I understand that he was excited that he won, but I felt like he didn't want me there. He said it was because he feels awkward around his teammates and coaches and that’s why he didn't want them to meet me.
He also said he was sorry his parents were looking for him

He asked me if I was going to a music festival and I said I was. He said he was coming then because I was gonna go. When I asked him a week before if he has going he said no because he is going on a sports tour to another country the weekend after the festival (they didn't even have tryouts yet). He asked me so come outside so see him because he was going away for a week without a kiss (I see this guy twice a month maybe). He said his parents were out of town so he can't really go out. On the day though he went to a pub to go play pool with his friends and stood me up for a second time.

We had a big argument about this and midway through the argument he asked me if I was going to his friend's prom's after party at a lodge. I got more upset because I told him multiple time no, because my mom is strict and I write my igcse math exam 3 days later. I reminded him of this and he said his friends (who I have met or spoken to) said it's because I'm a racist. He made a joke and told them that I don't like black people, I only like brown people.

He nitpicks my texts messages, if I don’t send a bunch of heart emojis after every text or only refer to him using pet names he flips out and asks I'm mad again. I also feel like he's cheating because he texted me randomly and basically said that a girl pulled him away and asked him about his friend Andrew because she was a crush on him, people were walking by and said
""mikes cheating"" because they had a crush on each other last year. I found that interesting because my bsf’s  asked her cousin who is friends with Mike about him and I. He said he had no idea he even had a girlfriend.

I just cannot seem to make my wife happy. What can I change? ,"My wife (40) and I(40M) have been married for 15 years. We have had our ups and downs. I have always tried to learn from the fights and improve our relationship.

I will just start. It is common in our country to live with family. The inheritance goes to sons in the family so responsibility comes to sons to take care of parents. I still live with my mother. We used to live with my brother and his family but I bought his share out and he has now moved to another place. It was divided into 3 parts; my mom, me and my brother, so I paid 1/3 of supposed worth of the property.

The house was old and needed to be rebuilt. The house and the land is under my mom's name. When building the house my wife suggested that I keep the property in my name because I would be spending my money to build the house. I talked to my mom and she seemed concerned because there have been a lot of instances where sons got the property in their name and kicked their parents out. It had recently happened to our close neighbor, so my mom was on edge. Honestly, I was a bit hurt but understood her concern. So, I agreed the house and land would still be under my mom's name. My wife said she is not happy and my brother and his family might claim our house after my mom's passing. We fought a bit and I told my wife to find a solution that makes her happy. My wife found a lawyer and made an official document (signed in front of government officials and legally binding ) that stated no matter what I would get the inheritance and my brother will get nothing. My brother and his wife also signed that paper. I thought everything is settled and everyone is happy.

But my wife was still not happy with this arrangement and she did not feel the house being built was hers. She used to say this all the time. I was alone when the construction began and had to oversee everything myself. We had major fights and I complained that she was not helping me. She made no monetary contribution. She had a business that would only earn enough for grocery. I used to get up everyday at 6 am and go to construction site l, come back at 9 am to home, work full time and check up on construction during lunch and start work again. The reason I had to be there was because workers would run out of things and would just complain about lack of material and stop working. I would personally check if anything would stop the work on that day and buy and arrange things so that work would not be disturbed. 

My wife and I had massive fights, she even ran away for few days without telling anyone. She came back like nothing happened. Then I called her brother and sister and said we need to talk and we need to figure out a solution. 

We talked and she said she would improve and be of more help. Our house was almost built at this point so I accepted and things got better.

She would still sometimes say the house doesn't feel like hers. I would ignore and I kinda understood because the property was under my mom's name.

After 2 years, she got a high paying job( I still make 2.5x more than her, used to be like 10x) . She saved a substantial amount of money enough to put a down payment on the property but not enough to outright buy it. I was happy for her. I helped her buy a new property. She put 40% from her savings, 40% loan and I contributed 20% from my savings. 

I worked day and night to find a property she liked. We agreed to buy it. I finally thought she would be happy to have her own property on her name. But she was not. No thank you, no smiling, she was just indifferent at the best and sad and angry at her worst.

I talked to her and said why are you not happy? You have a property under your name. I thought this is what you wanted. Why not a smile and not even a thank you. She just said you have never thanked me for cooking and cleaning why should I thank you for this? It is just not our culture. 

She said she works 14 hours a day. She wakes up at 6, leaves for work at 8 comes back at 6 and when she is done in the kitchen it is around 8, so technically she is right. But I also work, I cook and clean. She cooks during weekdays and I clean and I cook during weekends and she cleans.

This surprised the fuck out of me and is giving me existential crisis. I felt like I worked so hard to help with small and big things but I have not been able to make her happy. 

My father was abusive asshole so it always was in the back of my mind not to be like him.

I feel like my effort not to be like any other abusive husband doesn't matter. I want to keep my marriage fun and happy. I try and organize multi day international vacations twice a year, she is also not happy during those. She would complain about seeing similar stuffs even in different countries. She nevers plans or suggests a place. She pouts during the whole vacation. We used to go out to eat every Friday evening( so she doesn't need to cook on Fridays) , then she started complaining about food and the places we would go and would get upset. and that also broke down, we no longer do that. 

I helped as much as I could.  But when I try to talk to her and say we need to improve as a couple. She just says we have been married for 15 years and this is okay. There is nothing to improve and there will be fights between couples and this is fine.

This buying new property in her name thing happened two months ago. I kinda was expecting this to be such a milestone and bring new happiness in our life. My wife would have a property in her name. I worked so hard for it. I could not talk to her for two weeks because I was literally  looking for something that she would like every waking minute. After everything was finalized, I told her I was sorry that I was busy with this and let's celebrate by going out. We went out, she did not talk to me. I ordered food, she didn't touch the food. I asked her what's wrong, she didn't speak. I tried to joke but she was cold towards me. I asked her next day, she said she was irritated because of heat ( it was summer in my country). I thought okay. Then when I tried to kiss her she would avoid it, refuse hugs and sex. I got so confused, this was supposed to be a major milestone and make us even closer and happier but this continued for two more weeks.

After that something inside me died. I no longer want to do anything anymore for her. I cannot be happy. I just feel like everything I do is useless. She now shows affection but I no longer feel it. I just feel like no matter what I do, she will never be happy. I feel like she is just putting up facade and acting happy now because literally nothing has changed. The new property is still in her name. The old house is still in my mother's name. I can no longer bring myself to laugh or be happy around her. I have been a grumpy guy for 2 months now. I feel terrible and depressed. 

Tl;dr: I feel like I did all the small and big things for my wife but just cannot make her happy. Now I have turned into a grumpy old guy. What can I change to better this relationship? ",relationships,1728527925,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout
Even discipline doesn't help,"So, I wrote the first draft of a very, very short fanfic. Finally took the ""don't edit while you write"" advice. It worked. 

But now that I go back to the draft every day to edit it just a little bit, I feel like an idiot. Like an awkward newbie trying to make friends with at least someone. The feeling doesn't seem to be mutual. 

I look at the text and i know, I know that I need to change something, but I don't know exactly which thing needs to be changed. 

And I kind of don't want to continue working on this text at all anymore. Although when I wrote the first draft, I couldn't be stopped. 

Have you ever been in this situation?

"Examples of characters in emotionally abusive relationships, and thoughts on how to write them well?","So. I was in one emotionally abusive relationship for 3 years, another one for 2 years. I could give you many examples of 'situations' that happened to demonstrate it, but I would struggle to write a character living that life because I was too close to it so perhaps not aware enough of my own thoughts about the other party involved, and because of the insipid 'creeping' or gradual nature of emotional abuse. 

So it got me thinking. What examples do we have of characters in relationships like this, and how are they written/portrayed? What is the receiver's perspective and how does she feel about the person doing the abuse?

I thought of Thelma from Thelma and Louise who is naieve and bubbly and not aware of her own situation. I thought of the Handmaid's tail where Avglen (?) is aware of her situation and is a fighter but is also aware of the danger of the state so has to keep her head down. (I haven't read it for a long time so pls do correct if I've got it wrong!!!) 

Any others people can think of? Or interesting different perspectives of the person on the receiving end of the abuse? It's so easy to portray the receiver as a person who just creeps around and tries not to upset the person doing the abuse and whilst that was true for me, there's so much more to it than that, and a whole host of people with different personalities who end up in these situations!

My gf (29f) introduced me (22m) to someone as her friend.,"My gf introduced me to someone as her friend.

I guess we’re in what people call now an “age gap relationship”. I’m 22, she’s 29. Honestly, i don’t think it’s that much, but she makes a big deal out of it. She was first against us dating (we were first friends) because she thought I was too young for her. However, she came around to it and we’ve been dating officially for 2 months.

Cue to earlier today, and she referred to me as her friend to someone she knew that we ran into. (A church member of her church ) (we attend different churches.) I don’t like that she was dishonest to her about it. I talked to her about it after and she said she’s sorry but that she just hasn’t gotten used to the idea of me being younger and didn’t think about it. Again, we’re only 7 years apart. Clearly, she also didn’t want to introduce me as her bf.

I asked her if she’s embarrassed being with me or something and she said “no, of course not” and again, that she’s sorry. She didn’t seem to understand why I was upset and that she will introduce me to people.

She also hasn’t wanted to me visit her church and vice versa other than it’s too soon. Should I push for her to give me the respect I think I earn, or just let it go as something of her not being ready.?

Tl;dr gf introduced me to someone as her friend and not her bf. I have a different opinion on her as to how we should handle it.",relationships,1728530661,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

I don't mind their frequent hangouts, but I began to avoid them: now we spend a lot of weekends separately, he is with his friends, I have fun on my own. It worked at first, but now we fight a lot, my husband says that it is critically important for him that we spend time together in the company, and that I turn him against friends by not participating in their fun, because this way he has to choose how to spend his free time: with me or with them

I feel uncomfortable in their company, and I don't make him stay at home with me all the time, but that's not enough. I love him, what should i do?

Razor blades in class?,"I am a long-term sub for a 7th grade English class. I was a student teacher at this school last year and I’ve been subbing for this class since the first day of school (we are 7 weeks in). I have a student in one of my classes who has disruptive behaviors. I have spoken with his guardian and gotten more info about his background &amp; I have been trying different strategies to minimize his disruptions and keep him on-task. It’s very difficult. Yesterday I emailed the counselor asking for any ideas, to which she gave none. Today in class, I turned to look toward this student and saw he was holding 2-3 medium-sized razor blades in the palm of his hand. I quietly told him to go outside &amp; followed behind. I took the blades from him into a tissue. We stood outside the classroom because I had no one to watch my class. He was incredibly nonchalant, which is his general demeanor. He told me a different student gave them to him (said student was at that time in the health office). I asked an aide passing by to call a proctor to come escort the student to the office. They said the office wasn’t answering. They kept calling. As a sub, I’m not 100% sure of protocols, so I asked another aide from a different class who was passing by to also call. Several minutes passed. I saw the maintenance lead about 50 feet away and yelled for him to radio a proctor. No teachers have radios, but the proctors do. He radio’d and finally, after at least 10 minutes of standing outside with this kid, the VP and all of the proctors came over. The VP first asked what was going on. I told her this student had a few razor blades. Her next question was “how did this come up?” I thought that was weird. I said “I looked over and he was holding them?” She took him away as well as the other student who was walking back from the nurse. After school ended, the student came BACK to my class to ask an unrelated question. I was so surprised to see him. He said he did not get into any trouble and was just told to be careful when taking stuff from people. I talked to the VP &amp; counselor after school and they didn’t suspend either student and said “they did all they could.” They clearly didn’t want to talk about it and I didn’t push because I didn’t have my bearings yet— due to shock at the situation and probably because I’m not experienced and also shy. I was just wondering— is this normal? I felt like this was kind of a big deal… not being able to contact anyone for help in a serious situation as well as no consequences being given to the students seems insane to me. I know I didn’t handle this in the best way, but I was doing the best I could in the moment. ",teaching,1728434942,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout
Seeking Advice: Should I Pay Out of Pocket or Use a Personal Loan for Home Repairs?,"
Hey everyone! I could really use some advice, as I’ve never taken out a personal loan or a HELOC before. We need to do some repairs on our home, but we’re unsure of the best way to fund them. We have the money in our bank accounts to cover the costs, but we’re wondering if it’s smarter to take out a personal loan with smaller payments (and make extra principal payments) rather than withdrawing a large chunk of our savings at once.

Here’s the situation: We have a pretty large yard and were quoted around $12,000 to replace our entire privacy fence. We live in an HOA (please don’t come at me for that), and the fence is due for replacement. We tried doing one side ourselves, but honestly, it didn’t turn out great. Plus, we have a toddler, and both work full time (I actually have 2 jobs) so finding time and a sitter to continue the work has been nearly impossible. So we’ve turned to contractors for quotes.

In addition, we’ll need to replace our floors down the road, though we’re holding off until our elderly pets pass (they’re both very old grandpas now). We’re also pretty sure our AC won’t last more than a few more years, so we’d like to plan for that expense as well.

So, to the personal finance experts out there: Should we pay for the fence out of pocket? Take out a personal loan and pay it off aggressively? And what about the floors and AC—would a HELOC be better for those future expenses?

Leadership Feels Isolating. ,"Hey everyone,

I need to get this off my chest because leadership has become so isolating, and I’m struggling to carry the weight alone. When I first joined my company, it was a whirlwind. Within one week of my hire, there was a mass exodus of employees. Many of them were extremely loyal to the previous department manager, and I felt like I was stepping into a minefield right from the start.

I lead a team of field technicians, and every day I’m in the trenches with them – providing guidance, troubleshooting issues, setting up trainings to sharpen their skills, and ensuring they have the tools they need to succeed. On top of that, I’ve spent countless hours developing strategies for the department, brainstorming marketing ideas, budgeting, hiring, firing, coaching, and mentoring.

Recently, I hit my breaking point and had to sit down with the two owners. I told them I was burnt out and needed five days to unplug and recharge. They were supportive, but the sad truth is, I feel so distant from my team right now.

Now, my team is calling me a liar because they think I’m holding back on raises for them. That breaks my heart. I’ve been fighting so hard behind the scenes to get them raises and the recognition they deserve. I’ve spent hours in meetings, making the case for their pay increases, doing everything I can to support them – but they don’t see that.

It hurts. I’ve poured everything I have into this role, and it feels like none of it matters to them. Being a leader can be incredibly lonely. No one tells you how isolating it can be, or how sometimes, even when you give everything you have, it still feels like you’re walking a road alone.",Leadership,1728989026,burnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

How to engage with a Student one on one?,"So I am a part time teacher, and I am teaching English, to multiple groups at B1/B2 Levels. While I don't have official teaching certifications I am a native speaker in Spain and I think I am getting the hang of it. I also am tutoring this 13y old girl in English, Sciences, and some Math. This girl seems very bored and uninterested. I have a feeling that she is sick of school and learning and then is forced to come here to learn more. While I dont know her schedule exactly she seems to be in school from 9am to 5 pm, and then goes to my tutoring from 6:30 pm to 8pm.

She seems to be doing very basic things in English. She is going to an international school and it seems the classes are all in English. Sometimes I feel like I go to fast and she gets frustrated, other times it seems like she is just checked out of the class fiddling with her phone or calculator.

  
I do know she likes games, cause apparently her teacher makes them play on a website called https://wordwall.net/.  They seem very basic to me, stuff like crossword puzzles and matching tile games. I don't know if her level is that low or if she is just wasting my time.

  
I want to engage with her, so I asked her what songs and artists she likes. She mentioned Rihanna and Adele, so I wonder if there is a way I can do some listening exercises with songs to make her more engaged in learning, but I feel that some songs will either be too advanced or have rather poor English grammar.

Labeling in years ,"Is writing still labeling by the year it was published? [looking for labeling like Gen x, baby boomer etc]

When I read something without checking the publication date, I can often tell if it was written in the early 2000s. For instance, books like ""Twilight"" and ""Smile"" have distinct characteristics compared to the ""Percy Jackson"" series. While I know tropes are a big indicator of the time period, I personally notice differences in sentence structure and point of view that signal how old a piece of writing is.

LPT Make your email templates foolproof by not including [name goes here],"Do you ever need to write something (like an email) that will be used as a template for many other versions? Do you find yourself tempted to use placeholder text like \[NAME GOES HERE\] or \[REPLACE WITH DATE\]?

Write your initial template so that they work without these, so that if you should happen to forget to write in their name, it's still fine.

----Example template----

Hi!

I'm writing to let you know the book you borrowed recently is now overdue.

In this example, you can (and should) paste it and add the name after hi. But if you forget, you just look a bit impersonal, as opposed to if you had written hi (NAME) and forgotten to replace the name.

The expectation and workflow is the same - you endeavor to customize - but you have yourself covered if you forget.

Same goes for ""recently."" If you want to plan to also customize that, great, but now you've written your template that it makes sense even if you've been interrupted mid-email and forget to write in the date.

Happy National Coming Out Day to Christians Everywhere!,"Today, October 11, is National Coming Out Day in America and I cannot tell you how liberating it is to be an openly gay ELCA Lutheran.

I knew I was gay when I was 14, but I didn't tell my parents until I was 22 because my father is a Lutheran Pastor. I was terrified to tell my parents, and it was rough for a while, but I can't imagine what our relationship would have been had I not came out to my family. My brother -- who is also a Lutheran pastor -- said that the weight of being in the closet for caused me damage that took over a decade to heal. He said he didn't know what it was when we were kids, but he could tell something happened to me.

It's worth it to come out in church as well. If you have to hide who you are from your church family then you don't trust them, and they're not the right place for.

Finally, the best weapon I have to arm you with is Matthew 19 1-11. In it Jesus specifically sets a standard for divorce, a standard almost no Christian holds themselves to. That passage makes it very clear that almost everyone in a second marriage is living in sin. So, say that, read the passage if you have to, and then ask them why are they more concerned about you than they are about the divorced people in their lives.

They won't have an answer.

Keeping our low interest home as nest egg for college,"
I’m starting to do some planning for when we need to buy a bigger house in 2-4 years. We live in a desirable neighborhood in a LCOL and bought in 2019 at a 3.29 interest rate (house was $229). We pay extra each month on the principal, and I believe we probably have $60-70k of equity now. Our mortgage is around 15% of our take home income, so it’s very comfortable. That said, we are having a baby in January and will up our health care, dependent care, and daycare costs, so I’m trying to figure out saving for college costs and how much leftover we really have to dedicate to investing in a 529.

On the other hand, I do feel like we could continue paying down the principal of our house until we could get a $50k HELOC for a downpayment of a second house and rent out the first house — not really to make much money on the rental, but to hold the asset so that in 18-20 years, we could sell it and have a substantial amount of money for college. Is this something that people do? My thought is that focusing on paying down our current mortgage/saving for buying a larger house in a few more years may be more feasible than saving the amount necessary each month in a 529. We should still contribute some to that, but I’m struggling to find the wiggle room in our budget knowing that childcare costs will be incurring and we’ll be bringing less take home each month due to dependent care and extra medical coverage deductions. 

Some additional information:
1. When we bought the house, the bones had just been redone: new AC, new hot water heater, new electrical, new kitchen and bathroom, and they had to put on a new roof a couple years ago due to storm damage.
2. I think we could move out of our “cool” neighborhood to the suburbs and get a bigger house for under $380k, which would make our payment maybe $800-1000 more than what we’re paying now.
3. My one concern about our current house is our neighbor’s huge tree that abuts our backyard. She does not want to cut it down, despite it causing extensive damage to both of our houses, but I am hoping that if we maintain our side, that will protect our house.
4. We have a little under $50k in HYSA and max our 401k contributions. I am taking a higher paying job soon which will bring our combined income to around $200k; however our families are poor, and we financially support both + they have no overhead to help us out in a pinch.

What is going on with me?,"Hi everyone,

I've been struggling with panic attacks for about two years now, but they have always been manageable (to the point where I'd have a real shitty couple of days and then it would go away again for at least a month).

I finished my bachelor's degree (teacher training) in February and started my master's degree in March. Since March, my panic attacks have been horrendous - they only last for one day, but every single week before classes start again (I only have classes on Tuesday and Thursday), so on Monday, I'd be barely able to eat because of my anxiety and I'd just sit in my room all day, waiting for Tuesday to come. It gets better once I'm at uni, but once I'm there, I ask myself ""is this really worth it?"".

I just don't understand what's going on with me - I have good grades, I already have secured a spot at a wonderful school where I would be able to teach after I finish my master's degree, and I like my colleagues at uni. I'm already in therapy and my therapist told me that I seem stable and coping well with my panic attacks.

So now I'm asking myself - am I burned out? I sometimes catch myself missing the Covid lockdowns, or hoping that my lecturers get sick so that class would be cancelled or take place online. Quitting my studies and starting to work also scares me shitless, and the thought of starting to study something else breaks my heart because teaching is something that I aspired to do since I started primary school.

kinda considering to convert to islam as a christian,"
hello, i’m a christian my mom and i converted when i was around 8 or 9 years old, before that we were hindu. where i’m from (nepal), christians aren’t really accepted and they’re mainly discriminated i guess but it’s not like there isn’t a lot of them, it’s just majority of them are hindu. they call christianity a “foreigners religion” (bideshi dharma in nepali)

when i first converted, i didn’t really know what i was doing. i was just going to church, making friends and going to sunday school. as i grew older, i wouldn’t say that i was really close to God until this year. i’m christian, i pray and i have been going to church every sunday ever since i was 9 but i’ve done a lot of bad sinful things which i regret so much, ever since i got closer to God i’ve repented about it but i don’t think i really felt like i was at peace?

earlier this year, me &amp; my boyfriend started dating. he’s muslim and i’d say he’s like religious but also not SO religious? (as he says) we’ve talked about marriage and stuff because we both thought that it’s better to talk about all that now than to talk about it later and have it be a problem since we’re in an interfaith relationship and obviously there’s gonna be problems. we’ve talked about stuff like marriage, kids, etc. he never pressured or forced me to convert to islam and i would never convert just for him, i’m really grateful he doesn’t force me to because i know many people that kind of force their significant others to convert to their religion, i also know how some people convert for their s/o and i think that’s so wrong because i think that people should convert by their own faith. 

lately, i’ve been thinking of converting to islam. it all started when i was going through some problems and came across a playlist containing nasheeds, i was hesitant about listening to them because i wasn’t sure if i could like if it was right or wrong but eventually i listened and i felt so comforted, i felt so at peace. from then on i’ve been kind of reading about islam here and there and i told my boyfriend about it as well and he was obviously really happy about that. 

i also have this one friend who recently just converted and she’s changed so much as a person, she’s turned away from her old ways and i’m genuinely so happy for her and her achievements so far. 

the thing with islam is that i like how it’s one God and that’s that, it’s not like God then holy spirit and son of God (the holy trinity). and i also feel like i don’t really know much about christianity like if someone were to ask me to talk about christianity to them i genuinely would not know what to say (it’s happened before😭) because i don’t really understand it? i guess. but in islam i feel like it’s not complicated like that at all. also i feel like it’s not really forced because at church, there’s some things we have to do like dancing for certain events or other things and they force us to because “it’s for God” like we don’t have an option to say no because that’s what they say and we feel guilty about that. i just feel like some of the things i do are forced.

but i’ve seen the stuff that God has done in not only my life but also my moms life so sometimes i feel guilty about wanting to convert but at the same time i wanna learn more about it without converting first and i’ve told my boyfriend about that and he sends me reels about islam here and there and if i have any questions, he answers them.

i think for now i just wanna learn about islam but i’m not really sure what to do either because i’m kinda stuck the decision of what i wanna do but my boyfriend he comforts me and tells me to put it in God’s hands. 

if i do decide to convert, i have no idea what my mom’s reaction would be but i feel like my church would influence her about stuff especially now that i’m with a muslim guy because i know that people at church have done similar stuff like this, for example my church told this one sister to not marry this one guy even tho he was a pastor and another sister to not go to uk to study so that she can stay and do God’s work at our church. but at the same time, i know that our family isn’t really ENTIRELY supportive about us being christian and maybe she’d understand that because we’ve went thru this kinda when we became christian so i’m kinda hoping she’ll understand.

It's a pretty vicious cycle. I can show up when I'm scheduled to be somewhere, but I kind of zone out if I'm not actively engaged in face-to-face interaction with other people. I have no official diagnoses re: mental health, but I definitely think there is some kind of underlying condition here.

This also makes it difficult to make ends meet. I'm behind on my bills because I'm not working enough/making enough money because I can't get myself to do anything. Usually that carrot/stick relationship is enough to light a fire under me, but lately not even that is doing it. I've been burned out for years but don't have the financial stability or support system to take a break, so I just have to keep going. It feels like I've finally hit a point where I can't rally anymore, and that's just not an option. I'm not even meeting basic needs any more- I don't eat consistently because I can't get myself to get up in the morning and make breakfast, and during the day I can't get myself to meal prep/etc. I don't think my executive function has ever been this bad. I had a series of pretty awful events this spring/early summer punctuated by a car accident that really pushed me over the limit, I think. 

Again- I am seeking professional help, I'll be okay, I just need to be more productive. I'm just having a hard time right now and would appreciate any tips on how to rev the engine back up. Sorry if this was all word salad. Thank you for reading. ",burnedout,1725907607,burnedout,burnedout
"How Should I Invest an Extra $4500 Per Month?

Friend and roommate (26F) wrote me (25F) a letter telling me I am a bad friend,"My (25F) friend and roommate (26F) recently dropped off a letter to me detailing why I am a bad friend, and it has left me feeling extremely hurt and confused. 

We have been friends for 10 years, and roommates for two years. Things between us started becoming tense when I started dating a new man (35M), about two months ago, who is now my boyfriend. At the same time I started seeing him more, I also picked back up a longtime hobby of soccer, and play two times a week. Through this, I have also met more people that I have been spending time with. 

Admittedly, I haven’t been home as much. I work from home full time, so at the end of the day I’m itching to get out. My roommate works in the office and so our schedules are pretty different. I thought my not being home wasn’t a big deal, but my roommate became increasingly upset, and would resort to silent treatments, being short with me, and even removing photos we have with each other from the house. 

I decided to ask her what was wrong about a month ago. She claimed that she was just going through a tough period and had some health scares. Things returned to normal for about a week, and then the sulking, silent treatment, etc continued. I figured it was just her personal problems again, and continued on as normal until things became so uncomfortable that I asked her again last week if everything was okay. She gave me the “A-Okay” symbol, and that was it. I then texted her once she left and told her we needed to sit down and talk, clearly something is wrong and I’m confused. We agreed to talk a few days later when we were both free.

She then drops off a letter and tells me she doesn’t have the mental capacity to talk about things right now. I told her that I will read the letter, but it’s still important that we talk. 

So, I read the letter. It is a scathing detail of how I have abandoned my friends for a new relationship and don’t uphold my household duties. I was shocked. 

Not only is it confusing, but her narrative is completely different than mine. Sure, I am spending more time with my boyfriend, probably about 2 times a week, but I also looked back on the past two months to double check, and I have actually hung out with her and our mutual friend group 5 times. I have invited her to two outings with our mutual friends and she doesn’t show up. I’m really confused on where she has built this narrative from because to me, I haven’t abandoned anyone. I’m still spending a good chunk of time with my friends, and on top of that meeting new people and starting a hobby again. As far as the household duties go, I am also confused. We are both cleanly people and I routinely take the trash out, vacuum, put dishes away, and clean up my mess. It has never been an issue between us before.

She basically ended the letter saying she can’t support me anymore and can’t continue being disregarded. I’m really trying to see things from her perspective, but I’m also extremely hurt by the things she said in the letter and the way she handled the situation. We are going to talk eventually, but trying to gather my thoughts has been overwhelming to say the least. 

How should I go about sticking up for myself and communicating with her, while still keeping in mind she is also hurt?

Does subject matter… matter?,"Before I start, I’ll quickly say that I know subject matter is important to a a more obvious degree, in content, quality, and audience. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that my area of interest and what my current WIP is about is not exactly a trending topic. I’ve always been fascinated by novels/stories that place children in serious situations and in a more mature or adult context (think Stephen King works like IT or The Body, or Golding’s Lord of the Flies), so that’s the kind of thing I’ve been going for in my story. A group of young kids in a more serious situation that teeters on horror and blurs the lines of morality. It’s also historical fiction, and I don’t mean the 80s — which are quite a popular decade — but the 1920s and 1930s. It’s not that I dislike recent fiction or turn my nose up at anybody else’s preferences, it’s just not the sort of thing I’m terribly interested in writing. 

However, I just don’t know if I could see anyone except for me being interested and wanting to read my novel considering the themes that are usually sought after by agents and publishing houses. This sort of thing has sold well or been appreciated on occasion, but it’s not especially trendy at the moment in the book-world. To clarify, this isn’t really about money for me, but I’d still like to write something that other people read (and yes, eventually a bit of cash would be nice, but I’m smart enough to know that earning a living off of writing isn’t the easiest thing to accomplish).

I know people always say to write what you’re interested in, but I worry that I’m wasting a lot of time on a dream that I won’t be able to achieve unless I confirm or adapt my style accordingly. So, is it true that you should write you want and likeminded readers might follow, or is it better to try and write something more mainstream for commercial purposes?

(Also, I mean ‘worth writing’ in the sense that I wonder if it’s worth writing and then also trying to traditionally publish. I do write for myself too and enjoy my work, so I wouldn’t be put off writing it per say but I wonder if there’s even a chance of getting traditionally published if you don’t have a story that is trendy enough to probably sell well.)

Starting a tutoring company.,"
I was a tutor (working for a company) for roughly 5 years before I entered the youth working sector. I love my current youth work job, but want to start a business in addition to the 9-5.

Long-term burnout after English degree and children's book...how do I get it back?,"For context, I'm in my mid twenties, have a BA in English, and have one children's book under my belt. The book I wrote was commissioned by a former client for a reading program.

Prior to uni, I was a super voracious reader and writer. I used to pow back 5,000 words of writing each day and still be eager to get back at it the next day. Constantly had ideas, creative juices. 

Now that I'm working full-time (writing, but more in the less-fun digital marketing sphere than the creative) I find it very difficult to sit down and write something I genuinely love. I was ok with the first children's book, but the drained the living life out of me. I am working out a deal to do a second children's book, but I'm dreading it. It feels like a chore. Writing was always so freeing to me, but doing so now just feels like I'm getting beat over the head and nothing I do feels...good. Maybe I'm a bit defeated by the lack of intrigue in my first book or I felt it didn't live up to my expectations. Has anyone else experienced this?

Advice for First Book,"Good morning. I’d like some advice on approaching my first book. 

I’ve never completed a long-form writing project, nor been published in any capacity. I’m absolutely an amateur at writing, but trying to grow. 

That said, two months ago I started working on a non-fiction book based on the field I am in (healthcare). I feel very, very passionately about the subject I’m writing on, and would like to do it well. But now that I am three chapters in, I’m beginning to have doubts as to whether it would be doing justice to the subject matter to have this be my first book ever. It’s taken the wind out of my sails a bit with the project. 

Am I overthinking this? Or is it reasonable to consider placing the idea on the shelf for now, and let my first book be something that doesn’t mean so much to me? 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. ",writing,1728570011,nonburnedout,burnedout

My (25F) long distance girlfriend (23F) of 10+ yrs moved in and it’s going terribly.,"
i work full time, model and take care of my home. my girlfriend recently moved in with me and i feel like she doesn’t try to carry any weight. i do everything out of love but at times i’m feeling like she’s being ungrateful. i pay the bills, wake up at 5 am to drive her to work before i go to work myself, take a late lunch to bring her home after her shift and head back to work then cook dinner and spend the evening with her. recently, she’s been upsetting me. 

situation 1:
i’m sick (bad allergy cold) but on the way home from work, i grocery shopped and cooked us dinner. i spent the whole evening watching love island with her rather than hang with my friends on the game (she knew i blew them off for her). the next morning i woke up hungry but wanted to hang with my friends before our busy day. i made our coffee and asked if she could reheat my food from the night before for me while i hopped online. she said “give me 30 minutes, i’m not hungry”. i waited 2 hours until i went in my room and she’s on the phone and doing her nails. i reheated my food and went to sit down and she yells “can you bring me a napkin for my toes??”. i said “i’m eating”. she came out and said “you could’ve brought me a napkin you were right there. now i messed up my toes and have to redo them”. she said i was being spiteful by not getting her napkin and that she planned on warming it up after her nails but didn’t know she was being clocked for time to get my food to me in exactly 30 minutes. all i asked was that she communicated this rather than let me wait 2 hours. on top of this, the other day we got into a petty disagreement and afterwards she made herself dinner and nothing for me. it’s just a lack of consideration to me.

last night, i asked her in what ways does she feel that she goes out of her way for me or how does she try to make things easier for me and she was silent for a whole minute until she said “i clean sometimes”..

i lightly brought up how she seems ungrateful because one of the other things she does is complain if i don’t do absolutely everything for her. for example, i take my lunch late everyday to pick her up from work then i head back to work. she grabbed a couple groceries while at work and i let her carry the bags from the car to the door (like 4 of them) and she got upset and said “i’m so tired, my feet hurt and i’ve been working all day. you could at least be carrying these” so i carried half of them. 

finally, last night, she asked me if i’d like her to make me a bagel before work and i said yes. she didn’t. she doesn’t even wake up to say bye to me before i head to the office. 

i hope i’m not over exaggerating or being too hard on her but i’m exhausted and starting to feel taken advantage of. i have a lot to offer financially, i have a wonderful job and i am admittedly attractive and moving up in my modeling and now acting career. my family and friends all tell me i need to watch out for myself in regards to being used by people and i’m just unsure at the moment. before she got here it was all “i’m going to take care of you” but now she doesn’t go out of her way in a thoughtful manner for me in the slightest these days. other than wanting to be intimate. in turn, i’m finding it hard to be intimate and she’s complaining about that as well despite still not changing her behavior.

TLDR:
For context, we met when we were kids, dated on and off and officially moved in together now. My girlfriend recently moved in and puts in very little effort or consideration into our cohabitating. How do i get her to finally see my side and show a little consideration?

LPT You can use half of an extended warranty's price to estimate the costs typically incurred.,"Most warranty deals are about 50% profit (I used to sell this stuff). This can be for cars or electronics or appliances, nearly anything. For example if you are quoted $4000 for a 4 year extended warranty for your car, then on average people would spend $2000 across 4 years or about $500 a year. Even if you do not plan to buy a warranty, you can use this to help plan for possible upcoming expenses or compare how your product is doing against the fleet average. 

Right now my Tesla is in the shop for what is estimated to be around $800, which would be really annoying except the warranty deal offered was $3100 for only 2 years, and I'm already 10 months into when that would have started. So as long as my upcoming costs are about $750 for the next 14 months, then my car is nothing special. 

A different example is a Fitbit watch, they offer a 2 year warranty for just $30, on a ~$200 watch. So this lets us know that problems are probably quite rare, and having gone through warranty replacement a few times I can tell you, they just replace them. So if the value of that warranty is $15, and a replacement refurbished one is around $100-150 cost, then its likely around 10% chance the watch goes bad in the second to third year (they only include a 1 year warranty in the US but 2 years in the EU). This example does use a few estimates, but helps us guess a failure rate by playing with the varialbes.

How have you handled writing stories that are set as being in a different language than the one you're using to write the story?,"I ask because I know translation is an art much more than a science, and I can’t be the only one writing as if everything is in a different language.

I'm having ""fun"" because I just decided that there's three different ways of doing numbers- and two are solely for phone numbers. And now I have to figure out how to show this to the readers.

I've also have people talking about character choice in text messages, and notes about tone that I'm going to have to resolve in a future draft. Or leave as is, as that could be the POV character understanding the tone being used.

And talking about text messages, I have sometimes massive differences in word choices for characters in their texts versus their actual speach.

Because of the character based language they are supposedly writing in, you just can't easily say some things, and others are damn near impossible without the use of a third (and restricted-use) written language! 

And, yeah, I was sarcastic in my first use of the term, but figuring out all of these workarounds actually is FUN, albeit not necessarily in the moment I present myself with the problem.

It does delay my writing for a bit, sure, but all that really means is I'm building a specialty tool for this story, and when I'm done I can pull it out as needed in the future. Which will ultimately save me time.

Eventually, I hope to either create or hire someone to create the language being used for me, and do a ""native"" version of the story. But that won't be for years yet, if I ever manage it.",writing,1728550401,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

I tried RoyalRoad as well, but I feel like my writing was not gaining any visibility, because of how intense certain genres are on the site. 

Essentially, I feel like I want some interaction or the other, as that motivates me to keep writing. I know we are supposed to write for ourselves and all - but right now, I need some external validation. I majorly want to write in fantasy/slice-of-life genres.

For the past little while, I wake up every single day, do chores, go to work, help people, come home, help family, go to bed. The conversations I have with people are the same. Politics, US politics, hospital visits, negative stuff, estate issues, etc. Every single day.....

And on top of that, I have people telling me how to live my life, like who I should date (and trying to guilt tripping me into dating someone), telling me the same lectures and criticisms almost every single day and helping people that don't need help and more likely able to do it on their own (like today, I was helping out at a community supper take-out, one of the guests usually walks over to get their meal and wasn't able to due to hip issues, I ended up delivering it to them but found out later on today that the person was fine and was able to walk a good distance away from their place and socializing).

I'm pretty much fed up at this point, its got to the point where I'm tired of making everyone else happy and tired of helping everyone. I've been taking quick naps a lot more. I'm just to the point of being exhausted.

I draw and play video games where I can relax,  socialize and not worry about the real world but that's pretty much it.

"Why do we say ""help"" when we mean ""force""","I bounce around between different schools in the district based on need, and am not a classroom teacher. I have noticed a trend that has popped up not only in schools but also in parenting tips/advice videos.

Literally about fifteen minutes ago I saw a teacher with her arm underneath the shoulder of a 3rd or 4th grade boy, and she was walking him somewhere he clearly didn't want to go. The boy was walking, but reluctantly. The teacher said, ""Are you ready to walk? No? Okay, I'll keep helping."" Meaning she was going to keep her arm under his as they walked together. The boy wasn't limping, he was resisting.

I've also heard a parenting hack where it's like, if your kid is refusing to do something, you're supposed to say ""you have two choices--you can put your pajamas on by yourself, or, I will put my hands over your hands and help you put your pajamas on.""

This use of the word ""help"" makes my skin CRAWL. This is not what ""help"" means. If you consistently use the word this way, kids will grow up with negative associations about ""help."" I think it's a sick way of reframing it so that the adult doesn't feel like they're forcing the child to do something, but I doubt the child feels like they are receiving assistance of any kind. Anyway, it's just my pet peeve.",teaching,1728403367,nonburnedout,burnedout
22f and 23m navigating a complicated friendship," 

this is going to be a long one. Im 22(f) and he's 23(m). I will call him Skylar (this is a fake name)  this is our second summer knowing each other. I got a job in Alaska last summer and met him then, and we both came back this summer for another season. he just got out of an extremely toxic relationship that lasted four years, partially with the help of me. and at the end of 2023 I got out of an abusive year long relationship. 

 we shared the same off day this summer and we're the only two people who had that day off, so naturally we hung out. I didn't interact with Skylar outside of work much last summer bc his ex also worked for the same company and he lived in different housing then. so Ive really only gotten to know him in these past 6 months. and it's been a rollercoaster of a time. 

At the beginning of may he is showing me messages almost every day from his ex saying how much she hates him and doesn't want to be with him . He keeps telling her that they aren't together . He only wasn't blocking her because she crashed his car and no one was telling him anything about it . he also had to go home for a white to deal with the car ( but that trip is a story of its own ) Everyone around us was saying how cute we looked together but we were just two friends hanging out and getting to know each other. We would stay up most nights just talking. 

There are two coworkers (and they are a couple) I need to introduce, we will call them Ed and Sarah (these are fake names) Everything started after Sarah got back from her week long vacation and this overlapped with Skylar's trip back home to deal with his car and bank issues he was having.  I am the lead of the department I work for and Ed got the opportunity to become my assistant... He overstepped so much in his role and was on a power trip, so much so that I had to have a meeting with Ed and two of our bosses. 

During the meeting , the boss and I were just sitting there and the second boss was talking at Ed. He was telling Ed how he needs to stop focusing on the negatives of everything because he's getting too worked up about things that simply don't involve him. Everyone's moods would shift because Ed would get irritated over the smallest things. It was weird because every response Ed had he some how had to bring Skylar into it.  Ed was hyper fixated on everything Skylar was doing Even after the meeting we could not  figure out what his obsession with Skylar and me was about and it only got worse after this meeting. 

The next day the boss came up to me and checked on me. I told him it was a rough day even after the meeting. and the boss told me that Ed either needs to change his attitude or else he will get demoted. This is when Ed just started spiraling. He and Sarah started to cause a lot of drama in our lives because they got in contact with Skylar's ex girlfriend. 

long story short... for this part lol... ed, sarah, and his ex were harassing both me and skylar everyday for over a month both online and in person. I was getting death threats and my appearance and mannerisms hated on by all of them, simply because I was being a friend to skylar and trying to help him better his life.  And don't get me wrong, Skylar has his own set of issues and thats why I'm making this post. but it was just constant, for an example, skylars ex called him 107 times in one day. we just ended up turning our phones off most days during this time because we couldn't handle the constant harassment. 


^^ end of background information.

I think the fastest way to get this Information out is by a list. These are some of the events that have happened:

-skylar has unblocked and blocked his about 6 times in the 4 months we've been getting harassed (one of them being today... I saw a chat with her and he gave the same excuse... But the conversation was him saying that he wants nothing to do with her and that she needs to stop making new accounts and contacting him) 
-he has gotten annoyed when I dance with friends, on multiple occations
- he gave me edibles after i asked if they were edibles... He said no they were plain... I had a panic attack when i woke up high after the nap... he said it wasnt intentional 
-hes given his ex money bc he feels bad for her when she didn't have much... She was dependent on him. and that was only one time this summer.
-ive cried multiple times because of stuff he's said to me 

Another side note is that even though we don't label the relationship, we act like a couple. We do all the things and he has been so patient in that regard. He's been the first person I've hooked up with since certain things occurred. He also has stated that he wants to be more than friends but his actions with engaging with his ex make me hesitant to start that. 

i feel like im missing so much but my biggest issue is the lying and engaging with his ex who made our lives hell this summer. i have chosen to forgive him for a lot of the things that have happened. i am only at this job for three more weeks then I fly home. He is deciding to only go back to his home state for two weeks to see his child siblings and this grandfather. But other than that he has nowhere to go. At one point i was offering a unit my brother rents out or a room in my parents house that he could rent from them, both options are cheaper than anything other apartment. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm a highly anxious person and overthink a lot, I also deal with depression so I'm just trying to figure out if I'm overthinking any of rhis. For some reason I just can't walk away. I care about this man so much and i don't know if its at my detriment. I just need advice on what I should do. Do I cut him off in three weeks when I leave this job (that would be devastating to us both) or do I continue to make this friendship work? 

Let me know if there needs to be any clarification on anything, any advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR: A 22-year-old woman, recently out of an abusive relationship, developed a close friendship with a 23-year-old man named Skylar, who is recovering from a toxic four-year relationship. They faced intense harassment from his ex and two coworkers, leading to significant stress. Although they act like a couple, Skylar's ongoing contact with his ex and some troubling behaviors have created doubt. She feels conflicted about whether to cut ties after leaving their job in three weeks or continue the friendship, despite the emotional turmoil. She seeks advice on how to proceed.",relationships,1728578224,nonburnedout,burnedout

529 plan - most flexible for late starters,"Hello.

I did some research on all the plans, but couldn't find the following information.

- I'm a late starter. One of my kids is almost 13, the other is 10. I wanted to open a 529 ASAP and potentially front-load some $ into it so it starts growing asap. I am looking at various plans and understand that many are set up with age-related models, so the older the kid gets the more conservative the asset allocation becomes. Obviously for my case, I don't want/need that, I want my exposure to be more risky... is there a way to tailor the fund selection? I live in FL so I don't have any tax deductions... what's the best/cheapest and most flexible fund out there? I'd like to stay with a big name, like Vanguard etc... if possible. I understand Utah and Penn offer good 529s, but how's the online platform and customer service with those? Ideally I'd like to put the $ in the fund, have a decent selection of products, pick a couple and that's it. I don't want the re-balancing option according to age.

Any ideas? thank you",personalfinance,1728654549,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

LPT prep your vegetables on your off days to make cooking on busy days so much easier. ,"For so long, I'd go to the grocery store over the weekend, somehow thinking that I am going to be the type of person to prepare a from-scratch meal from A to Z on a weeknight. Then, what happens is that broccoli or bag of bok choy gets thrown into the crisper drawer, only to get thrown away weeks later, because, surprise surprise, I actually don't have the energy to do all that chopping during a weeknight, let alone the mess afterwards. 

This weekend, I tried a new method. On Sunday, I went to the store and got all my produce for the week: cabbage, carrots, broccoli, bok choy, peppers, etc. Then when I got home, instead of throwing them right into the fridge, I washed them all and cut them up, putting all the cut up veg into containers. I got two heads of garlic and chopped it all up in my food processor, also storing that in a container. I did the same thing with ginger but since I don't use that as much, I put the chopped ginger in a ziplock bag, pressing down to make it thin and then sticking it in the freezer. When I need ginger for a recipe, I'll just break off what I need. 

My weeknight dinner routine has completely changed for the better. Now that most of the time-consuming part of making the meal is done, when it's time for dinner I can get straight to cooking, I'm not wasting precious time chopping garlic or dicing a carrot. It doesn't sound seem like much but doing that prep beforehand is literally the difference between a healthy meal at home and expensive takeout from a restaurant. Also, I have way less dishes/mess to clean up after. ",LifeProTips,1727294784,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

How does anyone know what’s correct?,"TL;DR -- it seems that there is someone from every major religious background/spiritual belief system that seems to back their beliefs based on their ""personal relationship with God,"" but obviously not everyone can be right because so many belief systems manage to be so abstract from one another. Despite my tireless search for answers in my life, I do believe that there is a God, but my understanding of what version of God IS *GOD* leaves ms feeling lost and confused. I feel like I'm failing as a person by not just drowning myself in belief/faith, but certain aspects of every religion leaves me feeling like there's some form of false idolatry involved... which is literally breaking Commandment #1. Then again, it is also a major sin to deny God... and I'm not trying to do that either of course. But who am I to say that one person is lying over another? Knowing multiple people of multiple backgrounds who would DIE right now just to prove that they are committed to God as they see Him? Why is it all so vague and complicated? I understand the concept of having faith, but the best metaphor I can offer is feeling like I'm being thrown into a room with 25 people and being told that 24 of them are murderers but 1 will save me from a gruesome death -- and all I have to do is read all of their books and come to a conclusion of who is ""the good guy."" 

The Bible speaks at length about Satan being deceptive as well, which confuses me in and of itself because if *I* were Satan, I'd take full advantage of changing the book left behind thousands of years ago in order to either scare people away from God or make things as confusing as possible for those who want to lead honest lives and have a blessed eternal life after this one is over. Or, I'd flood the world with so much information and deceive so many people into believing that they have a direct connection with God, that nobody could ever narrow down what the truth was. It all leaves me feeling very scared, lost, alone and confused. I just want to be doing the right thing at the end of the day, but feel like it's nearly impossible.

LONGER VERSION:

Context: I consistently find myself seeking answers in The Bible, due to my upbringing and environment. As a teenager, I more or less flipped to agosticism/atheism over the years. As I've gotten older, however, I find myself leaning back on religion. I don't think it's proper to call myself a ""Christian,"" but that's what I grew up with and what feels familiar.

Question: No matter how many times I attempt to seek answers from The Bible, or gain knowledge/spiritual comfort, I find myself at a loss. There's so many religions in this world, beliefs, unique human experiences, etc. all the while we also experience things so similarly (I often think of the ""meme"" of sorts where people feel like something applies to them only and then everyone says ""Wait, this thing hasn't only happened to JUST me?! Have I EVER had a unique experience?!"")

That being said, within all of those religions and beliefs, so many people seem steadfast in their ways and claim that they have personally heard from God Himself or been shown ""the way."" But... who is right? Who is wrong? Is anyone right? Is anyone wrong?

I find myself in a mental spiral at times due to this. 

The Bible explicitly states that there is ONE God. And then there's Jesus, who is also God... but He's not separate from God or 1/3 God... He's 100% God, but so is God, and so is The Holy Spirit. So that's still one God... and then there's people from every background stating that the Christian God is not God, but XYZ religion's God is God. They back this with their spiritual teachings or personal experience in life.

To some, Jesus was a good man but also not God. But, if I don't accept Jesus, then I'm inherently denying God. I don't want to deny God, but I've never had some defining moment despite years of searching and studying for answers where I thought anything sounded correct.

Ultimately, I do believe in *A* God. But I also believe that anything that God may have wanted us to know now, was likely heavily tainted, edited or mistranslated over history. Even in modern dialect, there's a significant amount of mistranslation that takes place. How would script from thousands of years ago, accurately be translated as originally intended to modern English? There's so many translations of The Bible, to the extent that they can say VERY different things -- as if they're not even the same book. Beyond this, passing through so many hands over time and having so many ""authors,"" how am I supposed to discern if some evil person along the way wanted to deceive people and present God or God's teachings as different? 

Every time I ask these questions to people more educated than myself, I often receive an answer along the lines of:

""Have faith! If He just showed Himself to us, there'd be no reason to have faith!"" I'm familiar with the concept of faith, but EVERY religion says to have faith... I have faith that God is, but I feel like on one hand I'm worshipping a false idol in Jesus while on the other I'm potentially denying God by not ACCEPTING Jesus IS God. 

""The Bible is the Word of God, you just have to read it/absorb it/believe it."" There's so much conflicting information, and things that one person takes in a different way than another person. This is scary to me. Humans are notoriously awful at relaying information, even in the modern age where documentation/translation/transcription is easier than ever in human history. Nobody tampered with the texts of a 2,000 year old book? NOBODY?

""God has spoken to me directly/loudly/undeniabily and I KNOW His truths to be THE truth!"" I have connected with a relatively diverse set of people in my life. I have absolutely heard this statement about EVERY popular/major religious view at least once. I don't believe a majority of these people to be liars, but I feel that they're taking their own inner monologues as God speaking to them. And, with that knowledge, do I deny a schizophrenic man to be speaking the truth of a spiritual experience he had because he's labeled mentally ill? Or, could schizophrenia be of some spiritual origin that some are tapped in to? Looking at stuff like the story of Moses, if some guy ran around saying God spoke to him through a burning bush in the modern age, that guy would get thrown into a psychiatric hospital or disregarded as a drug abuser/liar spewing nonsense. Just because I'm not directly experiencing someone ""feeling/hearing God's presence in their life,"" within their belief system, doesn't give me the right to say they're lying or not. Nor does hearing some man in the street say that he's being tormented by demons or being sent by God for XYZ Purpose give me the right to call him mentally ill... then again, I don't want to enable someone's sickness and suggest that they should just pray away their woes to grow closer to God rather than seek treatment for an illness.

Everyone seems to claim to be right, but obviously not everyone can be right. I yearn for learning the truth. My prayers always start with the fact that I want to believe what God wants me to believe, and not what man wants me to believe. I want to receive the freedom, healing, love and eternal happiness allegedly offered by God to those who ""know Him"" and praise Him. But ultimately, I do not know Him. I can not see Him, hear Him, etc. and I feel that forcing myself to have faith isn't having faith at all. I also feel like I am in some way denying God or leaving a door open to false idolatry by praying to be steered in the proper direction. If I have the thought pop up in my mind to go read The Book of Mormon, is that my own human curiosity trying to fill in a blank, Satan trying to ""steer me away"" or is that God speaking to where to find answers? Where's the difference? 

I feel that I find myself steered away from all religion while yearning from God. It feels like there is a certain amount of evil in all of it, which I do not understand. A bad gut feeling. But does that bad gut feeling make ME evil, for being repulsed in a way by all of these various scriptures? Obviously modern technology allows for quick fact checking, but if I were to leave a deceptive set of texts laying around 1,000 years ago claiming that I was the first human that could float in thin air and someone got ahold of it after I was dead, and it was handed down for generations ... there's nobody to prove such things right or wrong. The later generations might have a massive divide over whether I was an insane, compulsive liar or if I was a magical being sent by The Divine that had special privilege to show His Glory.

I just feel lost, frustrated, scared, alone and confused. I've prayed until I had no more words left to pray, and left the door open for God to place what needed to be prayed upon my heart if I didn't already know it. Nothing. I've sought the prayers written in The Bible. Also nothing. I don't necessarily feel that everyone with spiritual experience/understanding is a liar (though I do feel that many are deceptive for personal gain at times,) but when I myself do not have this experience or concept to hold on to, it makes me wonder if I'm among the souls that will be eternally separated from God. I want to do the right thing, there's a desire to do good within my heart, but I find myself in a repetitive thought-loop where I think that I understand something followed by a complete non-understanding and confusion. But, there's no magical force or specific words in any set of religious text that seems to make me go ""AHA! This is the ONE!""

Does anyone have any insight or wisdom to offer? Were you once me, and then you found your way/understanding later on in life? Did my prior non-belief as a budding child into adulthood leave my soul eternally excluded, despite the fact I was just angry/confused? I'm still angry and confused, but nothing makes ANY sense if someone didn't start all of this. I think the world is ultimately a beautiful creation. There's just so much ugliness, hatred and division that it makes me want to crawl out of my skin attempting to figure out what is genuinely ""The Truth.""",Christianity,1728660942,nonburnedout,burnedout

Is Story Planning Supposed to Kill Motivation?,"Okay, this has been asked before and I know that. In fact, not sure if this'll be deleted but we'll see lol   
  
Skip to the end for TLDR if you want, cuz I wrote more than needed  
  
I finally decided to sit down and try to write a original novel as it’s one of my lifelong goals. Atm, I mostly write silly character interactions and OC x Canon (not necessarily ships), one shots, etc… So it’s my first kinda major project.

Things are going pretty smooth, as I found one of my old story concepts which easily revived my memories of those characters and their world (it's a kinda atypical plot of a MC actually part of this world they never realized I existed. And I love it.), and I quickly got to work fleshing out the characters and identities which was pretty easy and fun for me, and planning the arcs, coming up with plot elements and world building tidbits was especially fun!

However, it didn't take me long to realize I needed to  plan out the story. I’ve seen enough writing videos and advice to know that writing longform content like this is VERY different to one shots.

I'm pretty sure this question has been asked dozen times before, so I googled some options first, and tried out a couple of methods, like the 3 Act Story Structure, Hero's Journey, the Five Act structure...  
  
And on paper, it was rlly good advice! I see the point and I know why certain things are needed. But when I started to actually fill those out…it practically killed my motivation. So I dragged myself to finish that. But I couldn’t be able to put pen to paper to write anything at all. Like it feels like I have to drag myself through it, even though I already got a direction to start.  
  
After multiple attempts, I came to the conclusion that the lack of allowing myself to be creative and trying to stick to a structure was the issue. But I know it wasn't going to fly to try to write the story with no plan at all.

Maybe an make an argument that writing should be constantly worked on and not run purely on motivation, which I do agree with. I have fallen into those pitfalls before. But it just feels like I'm stuck before I even properly started.

I don't know. Is this a me-trying-to-run-on-motivation problem and I should just work through it? Is there a way to possibly plan without...planning it at the same time?



TLDR; Writing story structures drain me before I could even start writing the story. Not sure if it's a motivation problem or not. Asking advice on how to plan out the story with that in mind.

Edit: Thank you all for all your comments and advice :D
I'm not good at replying to comments, so I'll just say you guys all explained it pretty clearly and the approach I should go for. I will try those ASAP and will update on progress probably!!!

Maintenance company keeps trying to charge me on an expired credit card. Should I just ignore it or will it affect me in the future.,"I had a maintenance contract with a company for my home pest control at home. the contract was for 2 years and it has ended. I wrote an email to the customer care and ended the contract which was acknowledged. When I log into their portal, it does say that I am no longer an active customer.

However for the past one week, the company has been trying to charge my credit card for $199. Since the payment method I had provided in their portal is now an expired credit card, they keep getting declined.

I have no interest in reaching back to the company and figuring out what this is about. It should not be cancellation fees since the contract period has ended. I dont have any unpaid dues from any previous service. I am thinking this is just a way of that company trying to be unscrupulous with a lost customer.

As of now, I plan to ignore the failed transaction (once per day). What could happen in the future though? does this have any implication on my credit score or legal issue?

Sodomy in the bible ,"I know most ppl will look at Romans 1:26-27 and say yeah that refers to both male and female homosexuality but i came across this comment in another thread that was interesting. 


If you look at the grammar in the Greek, it's something to the effect of ""Having left the natural use of the women, the men in the same manner did things to each other, yes! Men with men.""

That STRONGLY suggests the previous text, literally ""Even for females of them changed their natural use into that against their nature"" refers to the way they were having sex with the men, not with each other.

… 

So women were having anal sex with men. 

I remember reading somewhere that in sick mind control experiments they would rape people anally to fracture the spirit. It can apparently deprogram the human mind. 

Would that mean anal sex in heterosexual marriage should also be forbidden? I don’t know if most ppl view that as a sin I never actually thought about it before. It’s definitely not natural and prolly why porn 
pushes it. Sodomy is anal sex hence Sodom?

WWYD from healthcare to tech switch ,"
I am a healthcare administrator with 18+ years of experience. I am at an executive level making 190k+ a year but I am approaching burnout in my early 40s. The amount of daily shit that I have to eat from employees, physicians and other administrators is ungodly. Let alone observing the worst behaviors and greed of highly paid clinicians that behave like children and are never happy. Although you could say I am in a great spot (and don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful), it is mentally taxing and I am starting to turn bitter and not contain my anger, which is spilling into my personal life. I know it is just a job and I should not care, and so far I had done a great job compartmentalizing but my compartments are overflowing now. 

I am thinking that it would be great to switch careers, get into an IT/IS career where I could be highly specialized, with comparable compensation, individual contributor and be able to do remote work and contract work perhaps (I know, don’t we all!), perhaps have multiple remote gigs. I am not naive knowing that you have to eat shit at any job, no matter what. But at least if I am in a specialized technical position I can focus on doing my own thing, it’s on me to deliver.

I am willing to take the classes, courses, certifications needed and do the work, I already have an engineering bachelors. For those that have first hand knowledge of the IT industry, what are some niches or areas that I should look into? Tech is such a broad spectrum, but recently cybersecurity has been popular and being pushed a lot, but is it really in high demand? It seems to me that it is overcrowded, or it will be soon.

Stuck and hopeless,"Hi,

I’ve been feeling burned out for a long time but in December 2023 it all became too much and I had to stop working (I’ve been off work ever since). This is the second time I’m experiencing a burn out but this time it’s way more intense.

The first time around it was very linked to a toxic work situation and me simply overworking and I was ‘over it’ within 3 months. I managed to get back to a healthy gym and eating routine.

This time around it feels a lot less straight forward, it wasn’t the workload that pushed me over the edge but more personal circumstances mixed with a shitty manager. I seem to be getting worse rather than better.

I’m struggling with:

- fatigue and even though I sleep 8h a night I wake up early and feel like I haven’t slept
- muscle pains and aches
- joint and shoulder pain
- lack of energy, I am unable to consistently go to the gym and exercise 
- digestion issues and heartburn
- extreme brain fog and numbness

I’ve gone to the doctor and had every possible test done but no results.

I’m seeing a therapist and psychosomatic physiotherapist but nothing seems to help.

The only time I felt a bit more hopeful was when I went on a short holiday and my symptoms were significantly less but returned the second I came back home.

I’m really frustrated because I’m trying to get better by: 

- going on walks
- eating healthy
- reducing screen time 
- seeking professional help
- building a sleep routine

But nothing seems to be working and I don’t know how to get better.

"Balancing Work, Dreams, and Burnout – Losing Motivation to Chase My Passion","I'm not sure if this is the right reddit for me or not.  Hope it is.



I'm a full-time employee, and my job pays me well (all bills are paid, and food is on my table). I still don't have my own home (rental). And I'm not trying to complain about the workload, even though I would like to because it's too much to handle. However, I must admit I'm blessed for being employed.  



I just started doing my master's (EMBA), first semester.  Assignments are kind of long but that's fine.  



In 2020, I found out that I love telling stories and making games (game development).  I even published a game on a well known website for PC games in 2021.  It didn't make me money, but I feel proud that I achieved that.



I had so much hope that one day I would become a full-time game developer but with my full-time job, but lately I don't have that energy to work on anything once I'm home.  I work from 7:30 AM till 4:30 PM; very often till 6 PM.  And even when I get home I have things to do for work.  So, I cannot just leave my work back at the office, I take it home with me.



Nowadays, I'm always tired and down and I started questioning about my dream of being a full-time game developer.  Even my PC that I built for this purpose only, now being used for work.  I even started telling myself that eventually, we will all die, so why bother following such dreams? But I get more depressed when this part of my brain starts talking this way.



I tried organizing my days but even when with that I ended up going home so tired after fighting at work and fell asleep on the coach.  



It's not that I don't have the time, it's that I don't have the energy to do anything.  I'm not even working out like I used to and it took it's toll on my weight.  I cannot lose weight not matter what.



I was diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality, borderline type.  But I'm unsure if this has something to do with my current emotional situation.



Even while typing this reddit post, I feel overwhelmed because I've never been able to talk my head out.

Friend of ours wants to route life insurance proceeds through our accounts. Are there tax or legal implications for us if we accept? Not sure I'm comfortable with it.,"*Original Pos*t:

Hello, a friend of my wife has been receiving periodic life insurance proceeds from the the passing of her family member, and she has noted that the policy will not allow them to withdraw more than $17,000/year without incurring a 40% tax. As such, she wants to have the trustee send money to us for us to then remit back to our friend

I am struggling to find any such tax (or penalty?) laws and am just generally uncomfortable with the arrangement and it's legitimacy. Should I be or am I overthinking it? Would it be considered a non-taxable gift to us? Thanks in advance.

  
*Edit/Update*:

We already politely declined the request after reading your guys' confirmatory opinions. But I did also get more clarification that I think makes a little more sense than was originally explained to me. Apparently, the withdrawal limit is a policy limit per beneficiary on the life insurance and the ""tax"" penalty seems more of a policy penalty for withdrawing over the limit within a single year. The spouse of the deceased is the trustee of the funds and the surviving parent to the aforementioned friend. My suspicion is that the policy allows for additional discretionary withdrawals in addition to the named beneficiaries.",personalfinance,1728658291,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

What do I do if I’m not smart enough? ,"This is a bit long of a rant so I do apologize- I just don’t have nowhere to go with this at the moment. Please be upfront with me. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Im a Junior in college who’s in the education program. Recently, I feel like I’m geniuely not smart enough to become a teacher. I’ve spent years in community college due to my hectic dysfunctional lifestyle. I spent at least a year taking remedial courses at C.C because I didn’t have a ACT or SAT score. I managed to graduate with 3 associates. Took a semester off, moved &amp; applied for an University. I’ve been at my UNI for a little bit over a year, and this semester has just been really tough. 

I have chronic migraines ( I have a neurologist I see yearly) &amp; I’m on the spectrum ( type 1 autism) 

Over the last couple of weeks, I missed at least 50% of the class material because of the severity of my chronic migraines which suddenly relapsed ( We had them undercontrol to less than 5 a month but suddenly I’ve had at least 10 in the last month or so) 

I’ve talked with my professor and she made sense about me not fully grasping the material because of my absences &amp; how she’s afraid I am not learning to the best of my ability. I really appreciated her honest advice. However, I can’t drop the two courses because I’m a full timer with 12 credits only. 

I’m trying really hard to manage everything and I’ve been trying my upmost best to stay caught up on everything. 

I am also helping raise ( along with my mother)  my sisters  4 children who’s all under the age 5- the youngest being only 7 months old. 

I just feel like I’m not smart enough to become a teacher. I struggle so much &amp; im in the point of my degree where I’m wondering “what If this doesn’t work out?”

I’ve always wanted to become a teacher because I understand what’s it like to hate learning as a child… but like what if I’m not smart enough? What do I do? I’ve spent years literally trying my best to become an educator… and now it all kinda feels real. If I’m not smart enough, what do I do this far into my degree plan? 

Its absolutely ridiculous how hard I’ve worked to just end up like this. I’ve spent the last 5 weeks crying myself to sleep.

What REALLY makes a story feel mature (to you),"I’ve seen people on this sub suggest that adult books (as in books aimed at a grown-up audience, older than YA) require lots of sex and/or violence to be successful, but I’ve always felt this was a fallacy. When you’re a kid, growing up, you will be drawn to things that seem more mature and want to leave things that feel ‘childish’ behind. This is why graphic fighting games like Mortal Kombat were so big in the 90s, why kids today love horror games like FNAF, and why teenage girls swoon over spicy romance.  Yet I don’t think anyone would describe those things as ‘mature’, even by adults who enjoy them (and I’m not saying adults can’t enjoy them; many prefer the simplicity and light themes, myself included). They give the appearance of maturity while being simple enough thematically to appeal to younger audiences. 

In fact, many of these things will be more overt to compensate. I’ve read plenty of books written for an adult audience that have little-to-no sex or violence, but I would never make the argument they were for kids because of their complex plots, subtle or dark themes, or content that would seem dull to teenage adrenaline junkies. I feel a book for adults meets its readers on their level, and doesn’t try to patronise or censor, but aim to be nuanced and not rely on fanservice for appeal.

Is it awful to resign after a company restructure that factored you in?,"The obvious answer to the question is yes, but please hear me out.

The latest restructure at my company involves me taking on more clients, something I have gently but repeatedly said doesn't allow me to perform at the best of my ability. The last time I was over this many accounts, I hit burnout and was not very well. When they communicated the new structure I voiced my concerns, and these were heard but not taken on board. But then, of course, it's their company, they are allowed to do what they need to to make it run properly and grow.

Since the restructure I've been handed the new clients with an immediate backlog of work, to help the boss ""clear their decks"". One week in and I'm already feeling very stressed, not sleeping well, my work is suffering and clients are beginning to notice. I'm trying to crack on and do my best, stay positive, manage time and priorities, but I can feel myself sinking mentally.

I would like to choose two other lenders, but **don't know how to choose and what criteria to use.**  I heard good things about Chase, but then saw some news articles that made me think differently.    
  
I assume what one ultimately wants from a lender is a good deal, ie. low interest rate and low down payment.  I have also heard good things about credit unions, but I am not a member of one.  Could I start an account with one and then get a mortgage?  


This is a first time home purchase for me and I would like to buy a multi-family unit.  I also need to find two lenders quick, because BOA has already run my credit 7 days ago and I hear if you run your credit multiple times within a 15 day window, it won't affect your credit score.

I feel conflicted about leaving my current part time tutoring job to take on a full-time special ed teacher aide role..Does anyone have any advice?,"
 
So yesterday I had an interview for a Special Education Teacher Aide position within a really good public school district I had my eye on for a while, and it went really well! The director woman I interviewed with gave me an application to fill out, and once I hand it into her (preferably as soon as possible), she will tell me the next steps in the hiring process (i.e., other paperwork and such, where I will be assigned and with whom, although she implied I would be working with an elementary school student, since I informed her the majority of my students that I tutor are on the younger side).


 
My parents and I were so happy because this is my first full-time job (with benefits!) since graduating college 3.5 years ago in 2021. The pay is ""eh,""  but not a significant issue since I live at home currently. The problem is, I feel conflicted about leaving my current (and only) part-time job as a tutor at an individually owned center belonging to a national chain of tutoring centers in the US. I love working with the kids, and my co-workers are alright too, but what drives me nuts (as someone on the autism spectrum) is my constantly changing schedule, which is why I am kind of eyeing leaving.


 
I also don’t have a car (I have my drivers license, but saving up for a car), and so my parents may have to drive me to and from work for now, and the distance from the town I will be working in and the town my current job is in is about 15-30 minutes away (depending on the traffic), but if I am coming to tutoring directly after school, then it might be that I will end up rushing to work (not sure about my end time, but my day should end between 3-3:30; once everything is finalized, then they will tell me the crucial details), and I don’t want to put the kind of pressure on my parents. And as for public transport, the schools are located within an area (a “boujee” suburb) where public transportation is not the best.
 


I feel bad if I left though, because I know there are always kids being enrolled in the center, and they seem to always be on the shorthanded side, even though they just hired several new tutors. My parents think I should just quit for the school year and then ask if I can come back on for the summer, even though it may not work like that (and the school district offers additional work after school and summer program work). I also don’t know if I could leave those kids I’ve established a relationship with after working there for almost 3 years now.

"Can’t complete a client project, lost all motivation and completely burned out. ","30+ years in IT and last several years in professional services as consultant. Typically clients bring difficult projects they cannot figure out themselves and we normally expect the projects to be quite challenging. It is very rare we get an easy project. 

The last project I have been assigned has been a nightmare. The task is quite tough. Vendor documentation is poorly written and doesn’t have the details to describe how exactly to do the job. 


I opened a support ticket with the vendor and it’s been weeks we are working on different scenarios with no luck. I feel like this 1 project not finishing on time has destroyed my confidence and I feel down every hour of the day. Typically I will not be negatively impacted and I would take it as a challenge. But not this time. I feel like there are details that had to be in the vendor manuals but for some reason omitted or assumed that I should know them. On the other hand, it is quite frustrating to be questioned multiple times a day by my own company and client and constantly explain the situation. 

And that’s what I hate about my job when it happens. One of these days I will find an easier job and quit. It’s making me quite unhappy to not have control over the details.

Now, I want to take a break from planning something a bit long after my hiatus from creative writing, but I'm scared that this short story idea I've been toying with will become another novella I need to plan before freely writing.

How do I (F29) and my boyfriend (M33) communicate better? ,"Without much context on our relationship, we've had a lot of ups and downs but still would like to make things work. Over the weekend, I (F29) felt really badly about him forgetting a detail about me: how tall I am. We've been together for a little under 1.5 years and it's come up a number of times. He immediately jumped to defend himself, as a way of trying to make me feel better, but instead just made me feel worse (i.e.: ""I don't remember ANYONE'S height). It was also while we were at a date that I planned, which made me feel even worse. He didn't apologize till we got home, over an hour later, and we talked it through. I could tell he didn't really understand, but he was trying. It was fine. He needs to write things down to remember them and I'm supportive of that. It's just that I *felt* bad and wanted to be held and sincerely told that he will try next time, because it was important to me.

We go through the next few days per normal: cooking dinner, eating together, watching TV, going to the gym. On Wednesday, after a super minor (but normal) interaction that made me feel off, I told him that it made me feel a little misunderstood, and that I think I'm realizing that after we have arguments, we might need to do something to break out of a routine.

He jumped to, and he's done this before, how ""he's always dating me."" That the time we spend around the house, walking to the gym, going to the gym, eating together, is an intentional choice that he makes on a daily basis. While I understand this notion, I think where I was getting at was that while that was also really important for me to maintain our relationship, I felt like I had a hard time jumping right back into the day to day things we do after an argument because I like to reset with a super special, out of the box activity that we can do together. It could be as simple as baking together, or going somewhere to play pool for an hour maybe.

He ended up getting sad. He felt like I didn't value your quality time enough to make me happy and therefore, what's the difference between that and him playing video games or hanging out with friends, if it didn't matter to me? I told him that while it did matter to me, it had more to do with how to make myself feel better. He then proceeded to say, ""ok, I guess we can do a date night after things like that happen"" while visibly still remaining upset. In fact, he wouldn't make eye contact with me at all. He said he won't be sad later, but at this point, I feel guilty about voicing how I felt and it just felt like the whole situation devolved into him feeling like the time he's spending with me is undervalued on a day to day basis because it's something he could be spending elsewhere, and felt like it was underappreciated it.

I tried to tell him that wasn't the case. Nothing I said could change the way he felt about it. He was still sad. I told him that if he wanted to do those ""other"" things, he should, but he should also be open to it if I ever told him that I wanted to spend time with him. He never really takes well to these conversations. It feels like the solution should never be to stop sharing altogether, but literally nothing I say, no matter how I say it, changes his perspective on things at all. It's really sad. I feel super disconnected from him as a result.

30 Minute Lessons No Materials Middle (ESL) Need a brain storm!,"Hey everybody, I work in Korea teaching ESL at an afternoon cram school. I've been teaching for 7 years and didn't expect this new position to catch me off guard, but it did!

This job has four 30 minute classes with middle schoolers (different grades but all intermediate level English), two of which are Mon/Wed/Fri, and the other two are Tues/Thurs. There are zero materials for these classes other than the whiteboard I have. There is no powerpoint, no books, and this job doesn't have an available computer/printer. 

I thought I could figure this out, but I'm at one month with this position now and I am really struggling. What I want to do is create a universal class structure, so the Mon/Tues would be the same lesson, and Wed/Thurs would be a different lesson. Friday I'm not worried about at the moment.

So far for the month I've tried a lot of different things, mostly different variations of standard ESL games that work with a whiteboard, and they were received well. The biggest success I've had is when I ran a random topic/memorization lesson. I wrote out 8 topics, students choose a number 1-8, and whichever number is the topic they have to talk about for however long they can. The other students who aren't speaking have to memorize their answer. 

So that worked best and had the most meaning in terms of practicing English, and that will be my Mon/Tues class. A bit of extra work for me, but I'll spend the weekend writing out a 100 topics or so and then that'll be it for a couple months at least.

The real problem I'm having is that, for some reason, I am completely blanking on creating a simple and stable lesson for the Wed/Thurs. I cannot think of what to do for some reason--- even reflecting on the month, while those ESL game/activities worked well and the kids were very responsive to them, they aren't really something that I can make an everyday lesson out of. For example, the students really responded to activities like ""Stop the Bus"" and category word lists (write out A-Z, and have the students come up with a word for each letter based on category). Fun and fast lessons, and while I have total freedom with the classroom and could just do that every Wed/Thurs I really don't want to--- it's just a bit too low in terms of the content for it to feel meaningful for me.

So I was just wondering if anyone has ever been in a similar situation, has any ideas? Maybe a variation on debate that I'm somehow missing that's simple and fun? I know the prior teacher basically ran on a single lesson for all classes, which seems to be that he wrote a sentence on the board and then had the students come up with a story, them speaking and he writing it out. That's fine, but it's not really my style--- I'd really rather have the students centered on something, like with the topic lesson I'll be doing Mon/Tues, because then it's student-led and I can also step back and let the students engage each other with different opinions and small fun arguments. 

So any ideas: A 30 minute lesson with no materials, middle schoolers, ESL, intermediate/high intermediate level. Even if you don't work in ESL I'd really to hear whatever ideas or experiences you've had with classes that solely depended on you as instructor rather than any materials. Really hoping I can solve this soon because it's wild walking into a classroom and not knowing what do at all, as happened yesterday. Totally blanked, and wow--- felt horrible. So! Eager to hear any ideas, willing to try just about anything. 

Thanks!

Do you guys have other ways to deal with Jehovah Witnesses?,"Debating religious zealots and other useful idiots of similar caliber is useless. Humilating them in public with snappy comments is the best way to tell them to shove off. 

As a French Atheist here, I only ever had to deal with them three times, they're forbidden by law to go from door to door to proselytize, but here's what I did:

-First time: Someone rings at my door, I look at the time. It's 8am on a Sunday and I live alone which means it HAS to be an emergency. Because I sleep nude, I take the time to put on underwear and my pants before running toward the door. Two 50-60ish women with wide smiles, the happy chirps of morning people and the light of angles in their eyes suddenly ask me:   
""Hello my Son, do you know God?""  
I pause, dumbstrucked, before replying angrily:  
""Yeah. You wanna see him?""  
Before undoing the cord of my pants and showing them my underwear. They back off, scoff and flee toward the next flapt.  
""HAVE A NICE DAY LADIES!""  
And I slammed the door hard enough to wake the whole building. First time they ever visited, the last time they did. Don't wake a sleeping atheist. Ever.



-Second time: I'm in the bus, reading Dan Simmon's Hyperion (classic 80's SF novel) and minding my own business. The bus stops, a 20 something woman enters and sits on the seat next to me. The bus starts rolling again then she asks what I'm reading. I show her the book and its title without talking, not interested in a conversation. But she pulls out a pamphlet and gives it to me while saying ""Well if you like reading maybe this could interest you."" I stop reading, grab it, realise it's from Watchtower, pause for dramatic effect (and searching for a premade punchline I had read a few nights prior) before giving it back politely to her with a simple ""No thanks, I don't need an imaginary sky daddy to deal with my mortality."" before going back to my book to ignore her royally. She exited at the next stop.



- Third time: I'm at my Grand Parents' for a family meal and melt into their swimming pool. The intercom buzzes and they groan. I ask them what's wrong. They tell me it must be the Jehovah's Witnesses and that they have been coming almost everyday for the last three weeks. I tell them I'll deal with it.  
I answer the intercom.  
""Yeah?""  
 ""We would like to talk to you about God. Can we come in?""  
""Great timing you guys, We were about to sacrifice a goat for the glory of Satan, wanna join?""  
""...""  
""... you still there?""  
Cut to six months later, at my grand parents for a november meal and the intercom buzzes, just the mailman this time. When my grandad comes back he comments that the Jehovah's Witness never came back. I tell them why and they have a good laugh, saying they'll use it should they ever come back.

Bulk foods are pretty much nonexistent at the moment unless it’s frozen veggies, oatmeal and maybe potatoes but I’m not really supposed to be eating . I cannot eat rice and bread all the other cheap filling foods. I gotta buy pricey coconut water and kombucha, probiotics, yogurt, etc.

"My 22F boyfriend 23M feels bored of me and the relationship. We have been together for 2 years. Should I try to put in the effort to be more fun or leave?

","Hello, I came here after my bf and I recently had a long discussion about our relationship.  
We have been living together for almost 2 years. We moved in together after 5 months of dating. He is currently depressed and under medication. He has been feeling this way for 3-4 months already. I didn't know anything and only found out randomly from his friend when he asked him if he is feeling bad anymore. I got very hurt because I felt like he didn't trust me enough to tell me how he has been feeling.  
  
We also don't have sex as often anymore, only like once every 4-5 days at best. And all week I've been going to him to get some attention, cuddle, get some love but he always refused me. This morning I got mad at him and said I would stop being so needy and stop asking for attention. He noticed right away, he even came up to me and acted like he wants to have sex and I refused him. I felt used and mad, he didn't even want to cuddle all week and now he wants my body. That started our fight. I asked him what's wrong and he finally said he is bored. That he doesn't desire me anymore because I don't initiate sex at all. He said that even if I go to him and kiss it's not enough. That he doesn't feel the spark anymore, and he wants me to have a spark, that he wants passion. I proceeded to ask him what kind of passion he means and he was pretty vague. Said that passion can be felt in my attitude and I don't have it. I don't bring excitement. He also said he doesn't want a granny and I act like one.

A bit about myself, yes I don't initiate sex because I have this issue where I can't concentrate on it. I only had one orgasm from someone else my whole life and it has nothing to do with him. I just can't get in the moment even if I'm in the mood. Also, I am passionate, just for different things. I am going through a period when I like staying by myself a lot. I paint, I love nature, I draw, I watch stuff, I sing, I cook and clean, go to college and go to work. And I find pleasure in it. I get very excited about some of these things and it brings me joy. I am content. I am also a very bubbly girl, I'm not sad a lot, I just love life. Not the most sociable but I am trying to find friends.

I got very hurt when he called me a granny and said he is bored. I asked him how he envisions a passionate relationship and he didn't want to further elaborate. I guess we grew a bit comfortable with each other and I didn't really initiate going out since I haven't been feeling like it. I just don't know how to go further about this. Also, he doesn't shower as often as I would like and I'd really hate to tell him that. I just don't want to initiate sex if he hasn't showered.  
  
I don't know if I can offer him what he wants to be honest but I still love him.  Also I am afraid that he is depressed because of the relationship because even though he loves me he used to date a lot. A lot of his serotonin and will to live came from the excitement to date people and have sex with them.  (He has a narcissistic past but he is better now)

We had discussions before about the fact that he is bored and we even discussed going into an open relationship or taking a break to solve it but I realized it's not what I want and gave up on it. I don't know how to act, I thought maybe I am too nice to him, always at his call and beck and that maybe I should stop and it will make things better, but I don't want to hold back my love if that's what I feel like.  
He also never comes up to me to talk, only tells me when it's too late and if I ask him numerous times what's wrong.  Should I try to put in the effort to be more fun and exciting or leave him to find what he is looking for?

**TLDR:** My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost two years, but things have gotten difficult recently. He's been struggling with depression, which I only found out through a friend, and our relationship feels distant. He says he's bored and that I don’t bring enough passion, which really hurt me. I love him, but I'm unsure how to give him what he wants, especially since I've been content with my own hobbies and life. I'm worried about where this relationship is heading, and I don't know what to do next.

The Simple Gospel That Saves/Declares You Righteous In God’s Eyes,"Jesus died on the cross so those that put their faith ONLY in His sin forgiving, death burial &amp; resurrection have peace with God &amp; STAND in that grace, knowing they are forgiven of past present and future sins, and have Jesus’ righteousness applied to their account forever and eternal life.  We are not saved nor do we remain saved by good works, imperfect obedience, perceived lack of sins or lack of “big sins”, or human will worship asceticism.  This does not mean grace is a license to sin but fact remains sin is no longer imputed.  To be easily reconciled with God forever:

The Gospel That Saves &amp; Imputes Jesus’ Perfect Righteousness To Your Account Forever:
1 Corinthians 15:1-4
2 Corinthians 5:17-21
Yes or No? Do you acknowledge your sin has separated you from God ?  Do you renounce any attempt to fix your sin problem and be declared righteous, as if you never sinned so you may enter heaven,  by your own good works, moral or religious, your perceived lack of sin by human will or asceticism, or thinking you are too good to go to hell because you consider yourself a good person compared to others, and trust only in Jesus’ (who is God, the fullness of God became man) finished work, which is His death burial and resurrection, for eternal life and Jesus righteousness imputed to your account so God declares you righteous (as if you never sinned past present or future) forever in His eyes and sin can never separate you from God again?  You cannot lose your eternal life once you trust only in Jesus to be declared righteous by God.  You cannot lose by moral imperfection what you did not attain by moral perfection.  Romans 8:31-39 &amp;
Ephesians 2:8-9  

Once saved study and learn the doctrine Jesus gave the Apostle Paul for the body of Christ , the church , in this dispensation of grace only found in Romans through Philemon. Image Jesus love and compassion back to the world and share the simple gospel that saves with others!

I don't enjoy writing anymore,"It's been a while since I've posted here. I realized today after staring at a blank page for the upteempth time that I don't enjoy writing anymore. I'm sure this has been posted by others before many times, but I'll share my take. It's been an uncomfortable revelation, but something I've known for a while now. 

For the last decade I've been pushing myself to write and complete something: a story, be it short story, a novel, etcetera. It's not that I've lacked ideas or premises per se, but after compiling some notes I've never had the desire to follow through. And I have a lot of notes. Everytime I've started, I would soon hit a wall. I haven't been able to get invested, and yet whenever I read or watch a good story, I'm confronted by what could only be defined as a sense of guilt for not putting my creativity and understanding to use. 

The last time I was really invested was about a decade ago, like I mentioned before. What was different is that I was fully invested in the characters, the setting, the world. I understood what my objective was, i.e. what I was trying to say. The meaning, not just what happens (plot). It's the furthest I've ever made it in completing a story, and to this day it remains as is. Every attempt since hasn't gotten past the conceptual stage. 

So what changed exactly? Simple: I did. I am struggling to reconnect with that old self, with those old stories of youth. And there's a sense of loss and grief associated with that. Back then writing was fun. It was a form of entertainment. It was about self expression. Expectations were minimal. The topics that come to me are disconnected from my old approach. And they're not entertaining per se. I suppose I've grown up in a way and yet I understand that this has affected my desire my write. 

I understand that this reads as more of a journal entry than a literal question. I suppose what I'm asking is have any of you managed to reconnect with your old selves and passion, or is there merit in leaving the past in the past and accepting one's current perspective and understanding while still finding some passion in the process?

i want to change my legally name but my mom already hates the name i chose,"for the purpose of keeping myself anonymous these are all fake names replacing the names in question. also sorry if it’s long i tend to over explain lol

I (25F) have always had a different name then my birth name since high school that my friends mostly called me by. this started when i began exploring my gender identity as a teen (identified as non binary for a while but now i’m comfortable as a cis); i was always pushed to be hyperfeminine by my mother (53F). i also grew up in a conservative christian household. 

both my first and middle name is after both of my grandmothers though the story goes that my mom wanted to name me Yessica but when i was born my grandmothers were arguing who’s name would be my first name. my mom ,tired from giving birth, caved and changed my name at the last minute. It never felt like *my name* if that makes sense. and the (actual) name my mom said she was gonna pick is beautiful and unique so there’s a part of me that feels like i was robbed if that makes any sense. 

so now i go by Daisy (it’s plant-related hippie type name). my mom has heard my friends call me this and always has a negative comment when she hears it (thfat’s such a dumb name, that’s NOT your name, etc). she also has this weird delusion that i hate my grandma (her mom) because i don’t talk to her often even though there is a language barrier between us. my mom never taught me spanish. every time i try to get my mom to talk to me in spanish and learn it never works out. i’ve tried to learn on my own but i loose it bc no one speaks spanish plus my grandma lives far away from us and we only see her like 2-3x a year. 

i feel like my mom would this im an asshole or disrespecting my grandma bc i don’t want to have that name anymore. it really isn’t a “family name” per se bc im the first child to have the name and again the name was thrusted upon me. plus i think names are kind of arbitrary and if an adult wants to change it then it shouldn’t be a big deal. i would most likely keep both grandma’s names as middle names or just get rid of both names entirely (i never ever use my middle name anyway). I’ve also considered going by the original name my mom chose for me, but she always thought this was a joke or a ridiculous idea

how do i go about doing this (besides the legal) and how do i get my mom on board without her getting super mad?  furthermore is it disrespectful to change your name if your named after someone else even though it wasn’t the intended name? 

Again, sorry for the long post but hopefully you guys can give some input and if your parent i would like to hear what u think too! thanks :)

td;lr i want to change my legally name since i do not go by it in most social settings but i’m named after my grandma and my mom would be offended if i change it. i would like to get her on board but don’t know how plus don’t know if it would be disrespectful to my mom. i have no emotional attachment to the name",relationships,1728516904,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

I don't want a relationship with my father but don't have a good enough reason for why,"I (29F) have only known my father (53M) since I was 16. My mother (54F), who I no longer speak to for a multitude of reasons divorced him when I was 3 and won full custody. I grew up being told he was gone forever, which I interpreted as dead, until I was told otherwise at 16 when his adult daughter showed up in my life unexpectedly and I suddenly had a whole other family I didn't know about. 

This is where things get complicated. My father lost his wife to cancer 2 years ago when she was 39. His wife was a nice person, but I never particularly felt close to her. My father's and I's relationship was essentially just a quick check in every now and then you until his wife died. Suddenly he wanted a bigger relationship from me, and over the past 2 years I've come to realise that I do not view him as a father, nor care for him more than someone would a casual colleague. I have 2 young kids, and since becoming a mother I just can't fathom as to why my parents never tried harder, and it's made me just realised I'm tired of trying. He's very emotionally draining, and tends to use me as a therapist. He never intentionally hurts me, but he lies a lot to ""protect me"" in very small ways like saying he paid his rego when he really didn't or saying he's not drinking when he has been. We don't live anywhere near each other, so it's not an impact on my life, but it's frustrating as I feel like I'm having to parent him. Whilst I have tried my best, I've come to realise that I don't particularly want a relationship with him, but I don't have a singular good reason to end the relationship without hurting him. I don't want to cause him pain, I just don't really feel like this man's daughter and it's always uncomfortable and draining to talk to him. I'm not sure what to do! 

TL;DR: I don't view my father as a farher, but don't have a good enough reason to cut ties and I'm not sure what to do. ",relationships,1728530305,nonburnedout,burnedout
Pay off rest of student loans right before buying a house?,"Hey everyone,

Wife and I did some traveling and are now ready to settle down and buy a house for the first time. Mortgage will most likely be under my name and the only debt I have left is $1,800 in federal student loans at about 3.5%. Our budget is $450k house and we will have around $70k cash on hand for down payment and closing costs (that is exclusive of $13k im saving for an e fund). I have an 811 credit score so my main question is: would paying off my remaining student loans have a *material* negative impact on the mortgage rate I’d get? My student loans are my oldest credit history so closing them out would presumably decrease my length of credit history, thus (slightly?) decrease my credit score, resulting in a (slightly?) worse mortgage rate. I’m sure I’m overthinking this but figure it’d be better to ask the masses before I pull the trigger.

Additionally, I’m curious if folks prefer paying them off, keeping the cash, or are indifferent between the two. I definitely see the side of it being nice to have the cash on hand while going through the home buying process but the other side of me thinks it’ll just be nice to be done paying off student loans. Let me know if there is anything pertinent I may have left out.

My first grader is struggling to read. Her school uses the Lucy Calkins curriculum. What should I do?,"My 6 year old daughter is struggling to read and is in a reading assistance program at school. We read together every night. I ask her to point out the words she knows, which is about a half dozen in total. I also point to each word as I read it and try to help her sound out the easier, one syllable words. She often tries to guess the word I'm pointing to, or even the rest of the sentence, or tells me 'there's a rat in the picture so the word is 'rat'.' When she does this, she's wrong 100% of the time. She CAN sound out words when she really tries. She can recognize the entire alphabet, both upper and lower case, with most of their corresponding sounds. She can also tell me easily how many syllables are in a particular word.

I recently learned about the controversy regarding this particular curriculum. As a parent who wants to help my child learn to read, what should I be focusing on at home to help fill in the gaps left from school?

But I have had a couple classes that are terrible, they don't do what I say and I can't manage them. I carry the weight of this at home and it's making me anxious and nervous. I love teaching but I don't want to do class management, I don't want to do power games, I don't want to yell. 

I was happy teaching piano, then I bought into the idea that I needed something more stable and tried teaching in middle school. The vast majority of people are advising me to stay in middle school because in my country (Italy) it's regarded as a stable job with good benefits.

I wish I never tried it so I wouldn't have to feel guilty. What good is it to have a stable job if it makes you suffer? What do you need money for, assuming you have enough to survive? 

I'm very conflicted and I don't know what to do...maybe I'll keep going a few more days, but it's painful. Whenever I read things like ""teaching in middle school is 70% class management"" I think why do I have to do this to myself if I can find another way to make a living?

I caught feelings to quickly and now idk if this guy is truly in a depressive episode or just not into me anymore,"Ok so I (20F) met this guy (23M) about 3 weeks ago. Ik it hasn’t been long, but bear with me because this whole situation is kinda confusing and idk what to do. 

When I first saw this guy, I thought “omg he’s exactly my type” but also thought there was no way I would ever actually get a chance with him. We swapped instagram’s and I thought that was that. But then he dm’d me the next day, was super flirty, and over the next few times we had set up a day to hangout. 

This is honestly part of where I think things may have gone wrong, because both of us only ever referenced them as “hangouts” and never “a date”. But in my eyes, it totally was a date. He drove to my place to pick me up, came to the door, took us to coffee and paid, then took me to watch the sunset and the buffalo at a nearby lookout. Am I crazy for thinking that’s a date?

We hung out for 5 hours, and only stopped because I had to get ready for work. During our time he had even mentioned other fun “hangout” ideas like taking me golfing and teaching me how to snowboard later on. He also said that it’s been a while since he’d done this with someone, in reference to our hangout. When I got back home he was already texting me how much fun he had and that he can’t wait to see me Sunday since we had already planned to hang that day as well. 

The next 2 times we hung out over the course of 2 weeks, it truly was just a hangout. I went over to his place and we watched football and ate dinner. The last time I’ve saw him he had invited me over to spend the night because we had to be at the same place the next day, and he said we could just carpool. 

All during the while, I’m over here catching some feelings probably way too fast. He’s a very physically affectionate person—which I love,— has the exact same type of humor as me, all of our mutuals have nothing but good things to say about him, and he’s just my type. 

But that morning after I spent the night is where I’m not quite sure what happened. When I woke up, my mom called because she needed help moving boxes out of storage, and he had a haircut appointment as well, so we both split up and said that we would just see each other later that night during our event. I could tell vibes were a little off that morning. He didn’t seem as energetic as he usually did, and wasn’t joking with me half as much as previous times. But I brushed it off at the time.

When we got to our event though, I felt as if he was acting like he didn’t even know me. He had mentioned previously when we were together that personal and professional life was a hard line that he always kept separate. So I did contribute some of that coldness to the fact that we were in a work environment and he was busy doing his job, but still I couldn’t help but get a little whip lash and the utter nothingness I was getting out of him. Ik it’s an extreme jump, but I’m an over-thinker, and all of our interactions at this time definitely made me felt like he was just not that into me anymore.

The event spanned over 3 days. Typically we’re both not very fast at responding over text as both of us have very busy lives (some days he literally has work and school from 4am - 7pm) but during these days my texts went unanswered for at least 8 hours, and sometimes it even took days when it hadn’t been like that previously. 

Some of his friend that were there with us had mentioned to me that his vibes were definitely off and moral seemed low, so I thought to check in at least. After the event was all wrapped up, I did reach out and ask him if he was doing ok. 

He told me: “I’ll be honest not good. But in a way of if I just need to ride the wave and it’ll get better with time and there’s not a lot else that can happen. I appreciate you’re checking up on me, means a lot”

This did soothe a little bit of my nerves about the whole thing. It’s just that ever since then, I’m lucky to get a response twice a day. I know that if he’s in a bad mental state rn, then texting honestly might just be hard rn. My problem is I have no idea where I stand at the moment. 

We have never said anything was a date previously, so are we even dating? We’ve been doing domestic stuff together when I’m at his place and we’re just chilling, but both of those times we did end up sleeping together. So is this just fwb?? 

I have never had a serious relationship. He is the second guy I’ve ever slept with, and he is also the first guy that I could see something more serious with. My standards are high and I refuse to settle, so actually being with someone who has checked all of my boxes is crazy for me and I don’t want to lose him in whatever capacity that may be. 

If he’s in a depressive episode right now, I want to be there for him, but because I’m not sure where we stand, I’m not sure what I can do that wouldn’t be overstepping. Because of all that I’ve kinda left the ball in his court. If he wants to hang out, I’ll let him ask. I want everything to be out of his willingness and not because he feels pressure if I ask. 

Right now in my head I’m just trying to emotionally detach I guess. All of my friend have said that I haven’t known him long, and that they’ve been played this way before too. When a guy say they have something going on but are just hiding the fact that they’re losing interest. 

**TL;DR; : What do I do from here? I’ve only known this guy for a month, I’ve already caught feelings, but now idk if he’s genuinely doing bad mentally or just needs an excuse. Do I just keep texting with him and see if he gets better eventually and asks me out again? But then idk how long that will take. And is it weird to hold out hope and wait that long for someone who I essentially haven’t even known that long? Or do I take this as a sign that I should just let it fade out and it was only ever a fwb situation for him?",relationships,1728574827,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) are having many arguments and are bad at communicating. What to do? ,"
My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We met at a bar almost 2 years ago and started off as friends and had lots of fun together. We went on a trip and our relationship developed further starting then. 

The first months were all good, and even moved in together. It was going good, up until a certain point where I started to question our relationship and him as well. That was around the same time my parents would bring up stuff about him they didn't like. 

My parents didn't like some of the things he would do (forget to put his chair in place at the table, forget his glass of water on the counter etc.). He also had an argument with my mom where he was super respectful and my mom not really. 

My mom started feeling resentful towards him from that point and compared him a lot to my ex (which she likes a lot) which is something I do not agree with. I agreed with my bf in regard to the argument they had, but noticed that since then, I feel a lot of resentment towards him as well, which I know is not right.

I realized at that point that I tend to be super influenced by my parent's opinions in general and that I'm figuring myself out in this time and that it's okay not to agree with them all the time, and that I'm my own person. I also realized that I love my parents and would have liked for them to like my boyfriend but that it's my life, therefore my decisions and can choose someone for myself. 

The thing is, since then, I noticed I tend to get super attentive to any little thing my boyfriend would do wrong and that I didn't like and had trouble choosing my battles. And would fight for stupid things with him. Some of them were fair battles to me, but some I agree weren't. And they're things I wouldn't normally bicker about. Along the way, he wasn't helping our arguments, as he wasn't very validating towards my feelings and could be disrespectful (name calling, raising his voice, sarcasm). I tend to be on the emotional side and he tends to be more rational. But the invalidating and disrespect did not help my resentment and feel he could have developed some towards me as well. I started feeling super insecure towards myself and our relationship. 

He started blaming all of our problems on me, and that didn't help my insecurities and resentment. At a certain point, I thought every argument was truly all my fault. I started seeing a therapist a few months ago and she truly helped me build my confidence and be more self-aware. She made me realized I have ADHD, hypersensitivity and trouble with calming my anger. She also helped me identify some childhood traumas that affect the person I am today and that I have a lot to unpack. I got better. 

But my boyfriend and I still had fights that would escalate for nothing and were on the verge of breaking up for a few times. We realized that it was all super toxic for both of us, but that we loved each other very much and are willing to try to make it work. He suggested we see a couples therapist, and have been seeing her for 7-8 sessions (1 every 2 weeks). He realized he also had issues on his end, such as controlling his anger as well, and being more kind in his words, in the way he is talking. And that he indeed had a role in our fights escalating. He also wants to start seeing a therapist on his own.

The couples therapist did help with some things, but we still have ups and downs. 

The thing is, I feel like we both have a lot of resentment and anger built up due to all the fights we had. We love each other very much, and we want to make it work, but I find it very hard dealing with my own weaknesses as well as his, and I feel he feels the same way. There was no cheating ever on either ends. We hurt each other without wanting to, and feel drained. And our fun moments are more rare than they were, but we still feel the connection and chemistry. 

I want it to get better, but find it so hard. Is it supposed to be this hard? Up to when is it fair to fight? How do you get rid of resentment? I truly want honest advice, wether it's in regards to myself or my boyfriend. 

TL;DR! My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) are having lots of arguments despite seeing a therapist. What is there to be done? ",relationships,1728566930,nonburnedout,burnedout
Publishing Contract - Questionable Translation Segment,"Hello guys!

Last year, I signed a contract with a publisher to have my book published in Portuguese (my native language). Now, the publisher is suggesting that we also publish an English version with another publisher they know. 

However, from our conversation, I would have to share the sales revenue percentage between the English publisher, my current publisher, and myself... I wasn’t very happy with that, especially because my understanding was that I could publish the book independently in another language. But now that this issue has come up, I went back to review the contract, and I don't think that's quite the case...

The contract states:  
""1. The AUTHOR grants the 'PUBLISHER' the right to negotiate the assignment of translation and publication rights of the work in a foreign language.  
2. The terms of the assignment referred to in the previous paragraph will be determined by both parties in writing and added to the present contract, at the time of translation proposals.""

Buying defined benefit plan years with 401k,Hello. I work for a state with a defined benefit pension plan.

I have the opportunity to buy service credits toward my defined benefit plan since it's coming from another public sector employer.

Mostly venting but would love any input on my post,"I’m mostly trying to figure out what I’m struggling with, whether it’s burn out from work or depression or something else. I plan on trying therapy soon either way. 

Over the summer since late May I’ve been working mostly 45 hours or more a week in a kitchen, I’ve always worked in restaurant kitchens and don’t hate it, but it’s the busiest I’ve ever worked in my life. My managers are very pessimistic and complain a lot and I’m no fan of them but I get along well with the people I work with. I have struggled with the workload though being constantly busy for about 9 hours a day, sometimes 12 or more and it messes with my sleep.

The first symptom I noticed was of course the exhaustion, pretty much all the time. I then noticed I started to not enjoy my hobbies. I stopped working out because I was so drained, I starting vaping a lot which I know doesn’t help at all and I’m starting to quit. But I go home and I don’t want to play video games, or read books, or watch anything. I started just scrolling tik tok to pass the time..

My biggest worry though is how it has affected my feelings for my relationship. I can barely find any research so far as to how burn out affects your life outside of work which is really why I’m posting here. I’m very close with my girlfriend and spend a lot of time with her. She’s just about perfect for me and supports me in just about every way she can.

But lately I kind of feel somewhat numb to loving. Like I KNOW the feeling is there but I’m just not feeling it all the way and it scares the hell out of me. It makes me question whether I’m really in love or not because I’ve never experienced mental illness while in a relationship before.

Why did God make us if he knew we were going to do so many bad things?,"My parents, very conservative Christians, would say that it's because he 'loves us'. But they also say that all of humanity's good achievements were god's, and all of the bad ones are our own fault. But he's supposed to know all, and so he knew that we'd do it before we did it? And there are multiple accounts of god actually \*making\* people do bad things??

'Exodus 7:13, And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.'

'1 Samuel 16:14, The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.'

Contradictions like this were what made me stop believing, but also the growing sense of 'what the fuck is this, a cult??' whenever I go to church. Also apparently Solomon the Wise had like, 700 wives and 300 concubines? I knew he was a king but damn, how'd he hook 1,000 bitches? I can't even get my cat to like me 🥲

The urges of temptation ,"This may be known, but for those who don’t know. I believe this is a massive thing to hear that will help with many battles of the urges of sin. 

So, In all honesty, I am massively affected by lust. However, I have been trying to navigate it so much where I stop failing god and giving into my lustful nature. I had just recently came to a crazy revelation within myself that genuinely makes sense and I believe should be shared for those as naive as I was. 

We all see the sins of the world and we deep down know the true reasons to the individual sins and it is the lack of individual discipline within ourselves. Our desire should be to live a life Jesus-like and adhere to the commandments. To go against these is to live without the discipline. 

Jesus instructed in the Bible that we fast, I always seen it as interesting but seen it as face value how I imagine a lot of others seen it to thinking it literally meant you would get closer to god but it has many connections with it. 

Sin is difficult and as we know as humans to break habits, you can’t just “stop”. It’s easy to say but not easy to put into practice without the necessary discipline behind you. When you look at all the teachings from both the Bible and Jesus, they all follow a principle of discipline rooted inside of them. 

If you take Jesus’s suggestion to fast and connect it. It is the basic start for growing your personal discipline to bring you closer to god because the devil is the one who rebelled and being the one who rebelled, he lacked the discipline that was required. To rebel is lack of discipline in its simple ways. 

By fasting, this is a fundamental practice to easily train our minds into mastering discipline because food is an urge all humans inevitably have but it is not a sin to eat. So using food as a growing stone by fasting and challenging yourself with your fasting is what strengthens the fortitude to eventually push this into other areas that reduce/remove our sins. 

 I genuinely believe this will help many understand a way to approach the issues of sin within themselves to eventually get to the point they are looking to reach. 

To further elaborate, for those who aren’t understanding on how fasting trains discipline is that food and water are necessities in our human lives. God has gave us them not only to live as humans but as tools to develop mentally and spiritually. It is a massive help for our discipline and we can utilise these tools to strengthen our mentality in areas we genuinely want to develop instead of seeing it how it is and just taking it for how it is. 

Growth is key in this journey you just need to learn how you can grow in your own way that makes the journey as clear as possible. ",Christianity,1728646399,nonburnedout,nonburnedout
"Was transitioning to new position, but now I’m doing both and failing at both. What should I do now?","Transition to new position and falling behind.

I’ve been with the same company for 12 yrs now. The last 2 years I’ve been struggling badly to keep up. The last year was a constant struggle to stay afloat. Working through my burn out probably damaged me more than I realized.

In any event, my discussion with upper management was to move to a new position that might provide me with more balance and control than my last position. However, since no one is available to take over my current role the discussion was for me to finish my current projects through June and slowly transition into my new role, starting with training for it this month. 

A few weeks ago our company landed the biggest project we’ve ever had. My boss thought it was a good idea I should be involved immediately under my new position/role. So I’ve been tasked with a massive project to start under this new position. I gravely underestimated the size and scope of the new project and my new role in it, and quite simple cannot manage to get it done, on top of the projects I’m currently managing in my old role. I have now completely missed my first deadline in the new position.

Before agreeing to the new position I said I wanted to be setup for success especially since my last couple of years I’ve been basically just trying to stay afloat and dig myself out of my hole. I said it would be nearly impossible to do both roles at the same time. Nevertheless, I’m doing both at the same time and now I’m failing at both. 

A lot of this is my fault because obviously I’m having a terrible time managing both and now missing deadlines for both. I’ve agree to try me new role as I was asked and agreed to the deadline. I missed the deadline. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s to the point where should I just leave the company. I’m failing both areas now. Should I tell my boss I can’t take the new role. 

My judgement is also clouded because I’m just so overwhelmed and the failure is eating me alive. This has consumed me for days and I just don’t know what to do.

Prophetic: Messages from God delivered through His prophets, often containing symbolic visions and future predictions.

Parabolic: Short, metaphorical stories used to convey moral or spiritual lessons, especially in the teachings of Jesus.

Wellness: Passages related to personal health, well-being, and moral conduct (e.g., dietary laws, healings, miracles, emotional/spiritual health).

Genealogical: Lineages tracing ancestry, showing God’s faithfulness across generations.

Metaphor: Use of metaphorical language to convey deeper spiritual truths.

Figurative: Figurative language that conveys ideas through symbolic or non-literal expressions.

Wisdom Literature: Practical living and philosophical questions found in Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job.

Poetry: Poetic expressions found in Psalms, Song of Solomon, and parts of the prophets, often blending metaphor and emotion.

Apocalyptic: Symbolic and visionary literature that focuses on future events and God's ultimate triumph, such as in Daniel and Revelation.

Covenantal: Focus on the covenants between God and humanity, such as the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and New Covenants.

Epistolary: Letters written to early Christian communities, found in the New Testament (e.g., Paul’s letters).

I feel like i'm being left behind at my workplace,"I'd love to get some advice maybe but i'd mostly just like to know if i'm being delusional or not.

I (27F) left work with a burnout late august last year. I was always one of the forerunners of my workplace, often was praised for my extra side work and innovative ideas and was told multiple times by my manager that she sees me growing towards a senior role. The company was going through rough times and there was lots of pressure on our department, this in combination with my manager being temporarily replaced with an outsider (with almost no knowledge and who did not actually function as a manager), I had to deal with a lot of things that usually are not in my scope of work and that gave me a lot of stress. Too much stress actually. I've been back at my job for a few months now, slowly increasing my working hours. 

Today i learned that the person who took over a part of my work responsibilities has gotten a better yearly review (sorry, not a native speaker) and most likely will soon be growing into the senior role. Although i've talked with my manager about getting my work responsibilities back, it's been left hanging in the air and i feel kind of betrayed.

By the time the rich guy noticed me and gave me a job I was already so burnt out and depressed I couldn't remember what I was doing from one minute to the next and I felt a significant cognitive decline.

However, I came back and started working two jobs... Again, I still couldn't remember what I was doing one minute to the next and sometimes I was getting dizzy and brain fog. I was so stubborn with what happened in NY that I actually decided to move back only to realize I was wayyy too tired and also just didn't wanna be there, and then came home again, I also really burnt the bridge with my old employer there and hoping someday it can be rebuilt(not as an employee just as people). Anyways, not I'm only working one job for two months now and I sleep a lot and I hardly do anything outside of work like I used to. I'm also not fast at work and make lots of mistakes. I've taken multivitamins and no longer get headaches and brain fog, but it seems like I don't fully have the energy I used to and still some cognitive decline (although my memory came back). Will I ever go back to normal?",burnedout,1724624142,burnedout,burnedout

Cautionary tale of a 1st century Jew,"Once upon a time, around 50 AD, there lived John the Pharisee. John was a great and devout Jew. He studied the words of the prophets and followed them closely, confident that God had spoken through them once and for all. He was well-versed in the Law of Moses, and like his fellow Pharisees, he believed in resurrection and angels, but always with the scriptures as his guide.

Then one day, he started hearing about one of his former peers, Saul—now calling himself Paul—preaching some very strange things. Paul claimed to have seen a vision of a man named Jesus Christ, but there were conflicting accounts of what really happened. Sometimes it was said he saw Jesus on the road, sometimes that it was a bright light. It seemed like Paul himself couldn’t keep the details straight.

Paul was claiming that Jesus, this carpenter from Nazareth, was not only the Messiah but that he had risen from the dead and was even divine! John had heard of this Jesus before, but he knew one thing for certain: He couldn’t be a true prophet of God. Jesus had added to the Law! Deuteronomy was very clear—not a single word should be added to or taken from the Law. Yet here was Jesus, doing things like healing on the Sabbath and forgiving sins as if he had the authority of God himself. Even worse, Paul was reinterpreting the scriptures to fit his narrative. John thought it was absurd—how could this Jesus be the Messiah when he clearly failed to fulfill the prophecies?

For instance, the Hebrew scriptures said that the Messiah would rule as a king and restore Israel to its glory, defeating all its enemies. But Jesus? He was crucified by the Romans! How could the true Messiah die like a criminal? Some of these new Christians were trying to twist the scriptures to explain away his death, claiming the Messiah’s role was spiritual, not political. But John knew better—centuries of rabbinic tradition couldn’t be wrong.

And the so-called “miracles” of Jesus? Just tricks, no doubt. Maybe some were fooled by them, but John was certain they were mere sleight of hand. He had even heard one story about Jesus healing a man with mud and spit. That hardly seemed like the work of a prophet! Plus, Jesus had clearly failed as a prophet. Didn’t he say that the end would come before that generation passed away? Well, here we are, and the world is still turning. According to the Law, that made him a false prophet.

Another thing John couldn’t understand was this claim that Jesus was somehow divine. The scriptures explicitly state that no one can see God and live. How could this Jesus, who walked and talked among people, be God? It was a clear contradiction. The Pharisees had been interpreting these scriptures for hundreds of years, and this new group wanted to tell them they were wrong?

John had also started hearing rumors that Jesus had ulterior motives. Some said that Jesus was only out for personal gain—perhaps fame, influence, or even power. Why else would he gather so many followers around him? John suspected that Jesus was trying to build a movement for his own benefit. Maybe he wanted to be seen as a great leader or a prophet so that people would admire him, serve him, and give him glory. Some claimed that Jesus had amassed a group of followers just to elevate himself, and look where that led—betrayed, arrested, and executed. A failed messiah if there ever was one.

Then there was the story that Jesus had risen from the dead. John found it laughable. If Jesus had truly risen, why was there so little proof? Only a handful of people claimed to have seen him alive again, and the story kept changing. Some said an angel moved the stone; others claimed they saw him on the road. And where was Jesus now? If he was really alive, shouldn’t he be out preaching? John suspected that someone had simply stolen the body.

Even worse, one of the men closest to Jesus, Judas, had fallen away. Judas had been one of his inner circle, but in the end, he betrayed Jesus to the authorities. If Judas, one of Jesus' chosen followers, could fall away, what did that say about Jesus’ movement? Clearly, it wasn’t divinely inspired if one of the twelve had turned against him. John thought it was obvious—if those closest to Jesus didn’t stick around, why should anyone believe in this so-called resurrection?

John was also puzzled by the contradictions within this new movement. Peter, one of Jesus’ closest followers, said that only Jews should be welcomed into the movement. But now Paul, a former Pharisee like John, was preaching to Gentiles and saying they could be saved without even following the Law of Moses! They couldn’t even agree on what their beliefs were, so how could they claim to have the truth?

What really troubled John, though, was that some of these Christians were treating Paul’s letters as scripture. This was outrageous! Scripture had been sealed with the prophet Malachi—God hadn’t spoken through prophets for hundreds of years, and everyone knew that. Yet here were these Christians claiming God was speaking again. They were even calling Paul’s letters scripture, as if they could be on the same level as the Torah or the Prophets! John thought it was laughable. How could they think there was any need for new scripture when they already had everything they needed in the Law and the Prophets?

To make matters worse, there were some people—like the Bereans—who were actually going along with Paul’s teachings! John had heard they were studying the scriptures, but instead of seeing that Paul was twisting them, they were somehow accepting his words! It was baffling. John was convinced they weren’t using the scriptures properly. If they were truly following scripture, they would reject Paul outright, because the scriptures clearly say God’s word is complete. We already have the Law and the Prophets, so why would God need to say more?

John also heard that some of Jesus' teachings were kept secret, shared only with a select few followers. That alone was enough to raise suspicions. If this Jesus was truly the Messiah, wouldn’t he want everyone to know all his teachings? What were they hiding? It made no sense—if they had the truth, there would be no need for secrecy. The fact that some teachings were kept hidden only proved to John that this movement was shrouded in deception.

And then there was the money. John wondered where all the money was going. He’d heard that the followers of Jesus were sharing their wealth, selling their property, and pooling their resources for some common cause. It sounded suspicious—was Paul, or one of the leaders, taking advantage of them for personal gain?

Despite his disagreements with the Sadducees, at least they had the good sense to stick with the scriptures and tradition. They agreed on all that was essential for salvation. They weren’t making wild claims about new revelations, divine visitations, or extra scripture. The Sadducees were wrong about a lot, but at least they weren’t being fooled by a false Messiah like these Christians.",Christianity,1728649566,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout

I don't know how atheists deal with a funeral but, for me I didn't have anything more to do. I'm mostly accepting to the concept of death and I had nothing more to do about my grandmother except for grieving at losing her as the misery of death's inevitability ate me out.

Understanding Financial/Retirement Scenarios,"Hello, I'm a 36-year-old female and I don't feel like I was ever fully equipped with the knowledge necessary to understand retirement, investments, or financial planning. I've been doing a ton of googling and listening to podcasts recently, trying to learn as much as I can, and I've put in a call to a financial planner for an initial consultation next week. I want to make sure I have all of my information and questions ready when I do meet with him, so I'm here to ask for some advice! From everything I've been researching, I feel like I'm in a pretty good place as far as employer retirement benefits go. I work a government job, and have almost 5 years of service with the State of Texas (ERS), and 8 years of service with the County where I currently work (TCDRS). There is some money in my ERS account, but I don't quite understand what that will get me later in life. The ERS website is not at all user friendly! I also have a TexaSaver 401(k) Plan through that job as well that has a tiny amount of money in it. My current TCDRS account is much easier to understand... I put 7% of my income into the account, the account grows by 7% interest every year, and when I retire my employer will provide a 200% match. I'm already vested, and only need 8 more years of service to be eligible to retire, meaning I could potentially retire at the age of 44! Other than that, I have a small personal savings account, but no other investments. This has all been a lot to think about, and I just want to be as prepared as I can be. What information should I have ready when I meet with the financial planner? What questions should I be ready to ask? Is there anything else I should be considering? Any advice would be so appreciated! ",personalfinance,1728656606,nonburnedout,nonburnedout
Is it ok using these tropes in my story?,"So I’m currently working on my story (more or less active) and after doing much research I came to find that two of the most hated fantasy writing tropes are “the farmboy to hero“ and the “resurrection “ tropes. I’m planning to use both of these in my story, but for a good reason. 

First of all the whole setting of this story is northern Germany and Denmark around the year 200 a.d. and the biggest Germanic settlements rarely had over 200 or 300 people (and I’m planning to make the book as historical accurate as it is possible for a fantasy story). So starting anywhere but in a village is literally not possible. 
Also I never really called my mc a farmboy, tho there is a scene where he is cleaning the stables of his cows and goats. 

Also I’m planning on making it a dilogy (two-book series) and during the end of my first book I’m planning to kill a character, who will be resurrected during the last chapters of the second book. While I know this is an absolutely hated trope (I hate it myself) I think I have good reasons for doing so. 

The second book is basically about the mc stopping a fanatic follower of the gods (his former mentor) who goes on a rampage and tries to kill all the souls in Helheim (Germanic hell) in order to stop the goddess Hel to be able to ever use these souls during Ragnarök to attack Asgard; and also it’s about the mc rescuing his best friend (and potentially lover/bromance(?)) who got kidnapped by said fanatic follower at the very end of the first book (there is also a very good reason for that, but I can’t elaborate everything in this post. But basically he serves as a slave creating special weapons for the antagonist). 

Now there is ofc a lot more of story and plot which I can not put in one single post, but basically after stopping his former mentor and the potential war he nearly started, the mc is in Helheim, seeing all the people he lost during his lifetime (parents, friends, and so on) and is granted by Hel herself to bring one person back with him (that is something that was very much possible in the Germanic mythology, as long as Hel is allowing it). And in the end his parents say he shall return the friend he lost during the end of the first book, since she was very young when she died. 
Basically this choice is supposed to mark a point where he starts looking at the present and values current relationships over lost ones if that makes any sense.

Is it ok to use these tropes or do they sound cheap and uncreative to you?

Likely Totaled Car - Actually Using Emergency Fund for Replacement Vehicle?,"I was in an accident last night, have never been in one before.  Insurance has stated I am at fault.  My car is currently at a tow lot and I will find out next week whether or not the car was totaled, but I'm assuming it will be.  My vehicle was a 2018 mazda 3 with 93k miles on it that I owned (no loan); I don't expect to get a whole lot from insurance.

We have enough of an emergency fund in an HYSA that I could buy a reasonable replacement in cash and we would still have ~37% of our original emergency fund, which would equate to about 2.25 months of Efund remaining.

I am pretty conservative/risk adverse with finances and we have never needed to pull from our Efund before, so this is tough for me.  Normally, I would absolutely just pull from the fund without a second thought, however we have a child in day care, and day care is not cheap.  We also plan on trying for number two next year with birth hopefully in 2026, so double day care.  I say this to bring up that I feel replenishing our Efund will be pretty challenging financially without dropping our retirement savings rate for a period / aggressively saving wherever we can for an extended period of time.

Am I insane for considering a loan just to keep our Efund balance higher?  I know one of the primary responses to this post will be along the lines of comparing my HYSA rate vs my car loan rate, etc.  This just happened and I do not know what my loan rate would be (hoping to figure this out very soon), but I have an 800+ credit score, so I can assume it would be the best available rate today, but still higher than my HYSA.  So obviously, from a pure number standpoint I would technically be better off just buying in cash.  

But I'm not approaching this from a pure numbers standpoint, but also an emotional one of having the security of having more Efund money available given our future plans.  In either scenario, replenishing Efund would become our primary focus financially.",personalfinance,1728661231,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout
What to do when my partner's (23M) problems start to be too much for me (22F) to handle?,"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been dating for about a year. I love him very much and the relationship itself is going very smoothly, but he's had a hard year – he moved at the beginning of this year and for some time now it has been looking like they'll have to move again (his aunt, who owns the apartment, is unreasonable and frankly just kind of crazy, doesn't take care of the apartment which needs essential repairs and is leaving the tenants in dangerous conditions). 

He's a pretty anxious person and this has been going on for a while, so he's been looking for apartments on and off for several months now, stressing about not being able to find any and at the same time not really knowing if they NEED to find any, as there are a lot of moving pieces and the decision to move isn't final.

On top of that there's been some other stress factors like changing jobs and finishing school and overall it's been a big year for him and I've done my best to be there to support him and console him in hard times. But I can't help but just feel exhausted at this point. He texts me something new about the moving / apartment hunting every single day and I don't even know what to say anymore. I feel like we're just ALWAYS talking about this, and I understand it's important to him and I'm supposed to be his support, but I need space to breathe too.

Is it bad of me to expect to lay some of the weight of his problems on someone else as well, like his friends or family? I kind of feel like when he hangs out with his friends, they tend to just get high and have fun, and then I'm there for all the hard stuff. I see it as a privilege to be the person he confides in the most, but it's just a lot.

Should I just grit my teeth and accept that supporting your partner no matter what is a part of a relationship? Or should I communicate this in some way? I've never been in a relationship this long so I'm a bit lost.

TLDR: My boyfriend's had a stressful year and I'm doing my best to be there for him, but being his main support for everything is starting to exhaust me. Do I have a bad mindset or should we talk this out?",relationships,1728578261,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

To make things worse my husband was taken to the army for a year so I'm in this s--t alone. I have relatives and friends who can help somewhat but I'm can't really ask them for help, it's an awful year for most of us: mom has stomach pain and now goes to the doctors to find out why, my best friend in hospital with kidney stones which caused serious inflammation, my grandma is old, so I just can't bother her, my other friends also have quite some stuff to figure out. I don't understand why everything is just such a mess. I can't comprehend what is going on in my life right now.

I'm trying not dive into selfhatred because I know I don't deserve this s--t but such thoughts keep seeping into my mind. I binge eat, gain weight and start hating myself for it. I binge read till late, I'm tired and I binge read even more.

It let's you accept that you're not okay and you don't do anything about it :))) Diaries on the other hand make it seem like you doing something useful when kinda you do but not really.

Notes is some kind of constatation of the fact that you are f-ed up right now constatation on the same level as shopping list. ""That's how it is: this, this and that"". No obligation or burden of keeping diary entries. Diary app designs mostly incline you to write regularly in the core of their design and in the end I feel pressured and guilty about not keeping it and that's not cool. If you have the same struggle you can try basic notes app ;) One important thing tho, write there something exept worries: the doctor someone recommended, movie lists, want-to-buy, random friends birthday etc. So it won't be sad trash bin.

How do you know it's time for a career break?,"Hi everyone,

I (F25) just got diagnosed with burnout and depression last week and start taking Ativan &amp; Cipralex.

I graduated university in September 2022 and started a job as a finance staff in a toxic company. I worked for up to 70 hours a week. Even when I manage to stream line my work and save time, I was still expected to work overtime because my general manager is not going home yet. Both my GM and direct supervisor are men, so everyday I have to endure subjected to lewd jokes (my husband (at the time fiance) is Arab, so lots of me loving big p*nis jokes going around). It's not helping that my direct supervisor is quite touchy, he would touch me on my thigh or even pat my head. Mind you, I'm in South East Asia where sexual harassment misconduct charge will just go away, so I figure to just suck it up. I think resigning too quickly will be bad for my CV and I need to wait it out at least 1 year in that hell hole.

It eventually becomes too unbearable that I had a full mental breakdown at the office on July 2023 and I had to take sick leave for the rest of the day. By that time, I already developed GERD and the acid reflux was hurting my ears and I had tendinitis on my shoulder. That July I submit my 2 months notice, then I applied to a new job and left for that company on September 2023.

My new company has more work load but no sexual harassment going on (in fact they have strict policy on that, so that's why I choose this company). But I still irrationally freeze when interacting my boss &amp; colleague. I am also still working until late and on weekends. The physical toll is still affecting me. My GERD is under control but now I have trouble sleeping. I consistently have low energy and feel exhausted that people around me noticed. Once in a while I caught my self wanting to unsubscribe from my life. I got flu every one or two months. Last week on Monday, after a 2 week leave from national holiday &amp; recovery from HFMD, I suddenly waking up crying. My whole body hurt, I feel tired, and I don't want to go to work. If my husband did not help me to get off my bed I might just stay all day.

Now that I taken my meds for almost a week, my energy level is getting better. Thoughts of unsubscribing from life is replaced with wanting to unsubsribing from work. I am thinking to follow my gut and take a career break, before my body completely break. However, my family and friend advise against it and that I should wait until September 2024 to round up my tenure here to 1 year. I just don't know if I can handle it considering I did just that last year. But now that I'm on meds will it be different? Is it possible to pull this through without a career break?

No healthy communication,"I'm turning to this sub reddit because I have no idea where else to go. 

I (23F) and my girlfriend (24F) will be celebrating 3 years together in November. We don't have a lot of fights, but when we do, we just can't communicate with eachother. Every small conflict either turns into a major hours long fight with AWFUL coping mechanisms, or we just agree to move on from it like nothing happened. We are pretty much complete opposites when it comes to our attachment styles and how we communicate. She's avoidant and I'm anxious. I'm very sensitive and emotional, always wanting to talk things out. She compartmentalizes and doesn't like to talk when she's upset. It's basically a recipe for disaster. 

Today, after a disagreement, we had a conversation about how we communicate when upset. I told her she could be more sensitive when talking to me so I don't end up feeling like she's upset with me. She told me she would just surpress the emotions and I shouldn't worry about it. I explained to her that  I don't want her to need to surpress her emotions, and that there's a way she can express how she feels without acting annoyed with me, but she wouldn't budge. I know my sensitivity is a large part of the issue, but I've offered many alternative communication strategies to help us get to the point I want to be at. She refuses to adopt any of my ideas and I feel like she antagonizes me whenever I bring up a problem. 

Today she told me ""I relent"", after I kept trying to explain to her how we can do something other than compartmentalizing and surpressing. I responded by saying that she doesn't need to relent and that I don't understand why she always sees these conversations as a battle. This struck a chord with her. She told me that no matter what she does, I tell her it's not enough. She said ""I do it my way and I'm wrong, I agree to do it your way and I'm still wrong"".

After that I had the feeling that there was a misunderstanding with what I was saying. She wouldn't let me talk after that though, and tried to leave. I chased after her and basically told her ""I didn't mean it like that, I don't want you to relent, I just want you to understand"". She just didn't reply after that, and I have a feeling she is going to give me the silent treatment.

I truly feel like I've communicated my side and my feelings as much as I can, but it just doesn't feel like anything I said or will say has or will ever change anything for us. I have no idea what to do.

In the middle of a work burnout,"I'm a middle manager, and part of my job is to enforce a policy that is against my core values resulting in burnout.

I tried to be open about my mental state with my managers and HR and I just felt dismissed and ignored. Feeling utterly helpless I have burnout which has been progressing as days and weeks fly by.

So far I took a day off after severe headache and fatigue almost caused me to blackout. That was the signal that made me aware of my burnout. I still had some trust in the system so I tried to be open and talk about this with my managers and hr. The lack of empathy have caused me to lose trust and now I feel like I'm in someone's crosshairs since I'm now getting 'constructive feedback'. I'm skeptical of everything at work now so I think it's becoming untenable.

Following this, I just could not find the motivation to work and everything is a chore. I notice that this is worse after I have a chat with my managers. Every interaction with them burns me out that I need a day or two to recover. I feel like I'm dying a thousand cuts.

I'm still fully functioning because of two things:
1. I'm learning to drive and I totally enjoy it. It has helped me reset my state of mind every week. I'm even surprised this activity sustained me because it has it's own stressful bits but I guess in a positive way.
2. I'm now actively looking for another job and interviewing. This one have calmed me down because it is a way to take back control.

I recognized that it was a problem a few weeks ago. I then turned to Jesus for the first time ever. I thought that it would work and that I could overcome this, but I’ve just been messing up. Not saying that Jesus hasn’t been helping me, it’s just that the demons have been taking over too easily. These feelings of lust are taking over too easily. This addiction is taking over too easily. At the beginning, I told myself not to feel really guilty if I slipped up every once in a while, because Jesus would still love me, would be there to guide me, and continue to guide me. The first few mistakes, I prayed afterwords, asking for forgiveness, and I wouldn’t feel extremely guilty initially. Maybe that’s my issue? I feel, though, that feeling guilty everytime it happens will only worsen things. Anyway, it’s happened so many times at this point, too many times for it to be “slip-ups”, too many times that I can’t help but feel guilty. At this point, I’m even just thinking I don’t deserve the forgiveness and the guidance. I don’t know what to do or where to go now. ",Christianity,1728651747,nonburnedout,burnedout

Blank page intimidates me--looking for a solution.,"This might not be the place for this question--if not, please redirect me.

I've noticed starting a story is great in my head, and then as soon I open a blank document, I freeze up and wander off to do anything but write.

I do, however, have no problem starting to write in a little comment box like this. Somehow the pressure is off; I can't explain it.

Anyway, my question is--are there websites, or programs, or something, where the writing field is formatted like a comment box? I don't want to just vomit my writing in a Reddit comment and risk posting it somewhere with an errant click just because it's easier for me to get my thoughts out here and paste them in a blank document later.

EDIT: I think I may have misrepresented myself here. It's not that I'm worried about my first draft being bad, or that I'm being a perfectionist in some way--it's more of an executive dysfunction of some sort? I have the words I want to write, the story I want to put down, it's just that something about a blank document makes me want to do anything else.

So the advice of ""don't worry, first drafts are supposed to be shit, just put anything down"" isn't quite what I need--but I appreciate the effort. What I need is a writing atmosphere to get me over the hump of being mentally stuck behind the brick wall that's not letting me put my first paragraph onto the page. Once I get a bit into a comment box or something with a lot of structure and design around where the text goes, I can copy and paste that into the blank document and be on my merry way.",writing,1728596690,nonburnedout,burnedout

My sister and I love each other a lot but keep having a lot of problems ,"  
TL;DR: I love my sister but I fear she is enabled by my parents and she wouldn't discuss that. What can I do?? How can I feel less depressed of losing my best friend that is her?  
  
I'm a 32 years old female and my sister is 38, we have a very close relationship. Since I was a little kid, we have share many good memories. She taught me about the best music bands, movies, series since I was like 4 and that's why we share a lot of our taste. She was and is very kind towards me, she has never bullied or abuse me in anyway. She studied medicine and I was so happy because that's what I wanted to do later (she was 16 when she chose that path and I was having that kind of dream at 10yo)

When I was like 8 I really liked to play tennis but my sister couldn't continue going so my parents took me off of tennis and I was upset but I accepted it. They said it was because ""school and homework was too much for my sister and we can't take you to tennis if she doesn't come"" so I let it go. But I was afraid of my futur as school as it was going to be so hard you don't even have time to do sport. Also, when she started medical school, they bought her a lot of books and equipement and she got an scolarship and thet would take her by car to the college and pick her up.

When I started high school I was like ""it wasn't as hard as I expected"" and I was a very good student and very autonomous. I went by bus everywhere and I had great friends that I keep up with today. Then I started medical school and it was very hard but I went trought a 3 months depression that I handled alone and then got in track. I got good grades and made friends and I was moving around by public transportation a lot. I also did sport and prepare my own food. And I started to say stuff ""mom you don't need to drive my sister around by car everywhere, I'm doing the same studies in the same town and we live in the same house, she can go by bus like me""

But she kept driving her. Then when my sisted was doing her specialization it got worse because it was like THE hardest part and my parents would even do her laundry. At that time I was busy with my own medical studies but I would do my laundry, my food, even if I didn't pay for it, I would organize me to do it myself.

All this time my sister and I were in great terms and sharing time together talking at night about music or parties. Then my sister left to Argentina and she stopped working as a doctor, started working at a call center, made a lot of tattoos, became an astrologer and I was like ""do whatever makes you happy, but be careful because economic situation in our country Venezuela is CRAZY, so just do what makes you happy but be autonomous""

My mom sent her money, not a lot in general terms, but a lot in Venezuela's context. Like 4000 dollars. And I started to get upset because I, as I'm the younger child and I lived still with my mom, I felt that was household money that we needed.

Then I also left the country and I started helping my mom with her medical conditions. She has a chronic disease and the treatement is not available in Venezuela. I would send the money to my sister and she would buy it and send it. No money was asked to my sister never.

And one year my sister said: ""I can't send the medicines. You need to get off my back with that errand. I have my life, my schedules here and can't do as you and mom wish""

I told her to please reconsider, I told her I could pay extra money to her for her trouble and I would pay the integrity of the treament and the delivery. But she said ""no""

I asked a friend that lived in Argentina and we did the errand together. Later, my sister was having economic problems and my mom sent her money. After that, she agreed to do the errand of buying the treatement to my mom(that I payed). I think she was mellowed by the fact that my mom sent more money.

She had no more money to keep living in Argentina, so she went back to our country. My mom payed the ticket. And now they have a lot of very real money issues. Even if she works, it is not enough money.

So I send a bit of money but I told to my sister everthing that I just wrote. I told her she had every facility and confort and didn't have. I told her it was unfair I have to send money by my own and specially that even if I sent the money, she didn't agree to do the errand for my mom's treament.

She told me I was so bitter and resentful. She stopped talking to me. My mom told me to not send anything, even if it means she gets sick or bedridden. They said I had no right to judge my sister or my mom. That I was carrying a back of rocks and I was ready to throw them whenever they need help.

I feel so depressed. I haven't speak to my sister in days because she wouldn't answer. I sent money to my mom because she needed them for shoes and she didn't ask but I want my mom to have shoes. I don't know what to do. I felt I hurted my sister beyond reparable and I apologized deeply but she didn't answer. I was doing sports, studying, working and know I have problems to get out of bed or focus. Any advice with this situation?

TL;DR: I love my sister but I fear she is enabled by my parents and she wouldn't discuss that. What can I do?? How can I feel less depressed of losing my best friend that is her?

2. My eyes feel tired: They just feel rough, sandy. I want to close them.
3. No motivation: I didn’t take out the recycling yesterday cause I was too unmotivated.
4. Find it hard to get out of bed: I can’t sit up straight and work at my desk.
5. Irritable and negative: I spazz out, short fuse, I don't want to be around people cause I suck right now.
6. Headaches:I am someone who usually never gets headaches, but it’s like a radiating pain behind my nose, behind my eyes, and in my head.
7. Lack of sleep:I am so overwhelmed in my day to day, it spills over to my sleep and I get nightmares.
8. Huge appetite: I just want to eat all the time, which has resulted in some weight gain.
9. Lack of concentration/brain fog:I forget what I’m saying, can only watch brain rot content.
10. Feeling guilty:I feel really guilty about resting, but my body has taken over and is saying “no”, I see other people working hard and doing way more work than me and I feel like a pathetic loser.

**Lifestyle Changes**

1. Small business owner (x2): I quit a toxic environment corporate job and opened two small businesses, I am grateful that I am slammed on both of them. Most of my energy goes towards this if I have any.
2. Neglectful Partner: One of the small businesses is a partnership and my partner is neglecting some major stuff, which is mostly because they are out of town, but I bear most of the weight of running it.
3. Overwhelmed: Because of the success of my business, I feel like I have over 100 things on my list at all times.
4. Seasonal Affectional Disorder: I find that in the summer and winter I get lazy.

**Routine**

10pm: Go to bed

7:00am: Drink 3 cups of coffee for some sense of motivation (which is way down from before)

8am: Walk my dogs

9am: Try to do some work

9:30am: Headache, fatigue and hunger comes on and I have to lie down

Rest of the day: Try to rest, try to do work, stuck in this prison in my head where I want so badly to get up and do stuff but my legs are in agony, I have a headache, I'm exhausted

5pm: Walk dogs again

**Bad Solutions**

The reality for me right now is that I am struggling.

1. I want to drink: I know this won't help at all, but I just want to feel good, even for a minute. I lie in bed and it's torture. I haven't felt good in my own body in a few days and it's been miserable. I don't drink cause I know it will make it worse.
2. Considering smoking weed: Just instead of drinking, and hopefully be able to escape. I hate just lying in bed, I feel pathetic, I want so badly to feel good and am considering substances to escape how I feel.

All my energy these days go the bare minimum, which is taking care of my animals and cleaning and brushing my teeth, trimming my beard, doing my laundry, etc. The bare minimum is enough to exhaust me.

Looking back and reflecting, I think I got burnt out years ago. Anyway, I feel like I'm just being pathetic and asking for sympathy.",burnedout,1724850018,burnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout
Underwriter here. How do I add internalization and softer scene breaks without them feeling like filler?,"My manuscript was long- and shortlisted by editors of RevPit. One of them gave me the critique that the main character needs more internalization to make the reader relate with the MC more. Whereas another editor said they were able to engage with the character but had problems with my harsh scene breaks.

"TD guilty plea, should I move money","I've had a TD savings account for decades now, with a bit of money stored away in it. I've also carried a credit card with them for the past decade using it for everyday expenses, and that credit really the main thing keeping my credit score up since I hate being in debt.

With the news that they [pleaded guilty](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/td-bank-pleads-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-and-money-laundering-conspiracy-violations-18b) to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, and expected to pay $1.8 billion in penalties, should I consider moving my money out of that account and into another bank? While I'm well within the FDIC limit and am not worried about losing my money if TD goes under, I don't want to lose the one thing keeping my credit score consistently above 750 either. I also really like TD's fraud detection, they caught a would-be identity thief in 2020 before they could spend any of my money.

I do have 2 HYSA (one with another bank, the other in a credit union), but I don't have checking or credit with either, so I'd have to get that set up first before moving anything. But how hard is it to close all these accounts? I've never really done that before since I've had this TD account since high school.",personalfinance,1728661737,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

When the Romans Conquered Britain,"In the mid 1st century CE one of the problems they did not anticipate was the rampant fraud being conducted in the bronze trade. Tradesmen who shaped the metal would buy it from merchants who bought it from the miners in the form of bars of bronze, already mixed from copper and tin.

The issue was that many bars were of inferior quality possessing too much tin which resulted in brittle bronze. The merchants of course would say that they had been told it was good quality, whereas the forgers would report that it had been discounted for being imperfect batches, good for decorative work but not suitable for tools, to which the merchants were the ones being fraudulent by trying to sell it at full price.

Gnaeus Julius Agricola, leader of the Roman settlements at the time, made a ruling forbidding merchants from selling raw metal forcing the Tradesmen to buy directly from the miners which was the first codified example known of the ""He who smelt it, dealt it,"" rule.

  
In clearing the backlog of such cases he also heard a dispute where a tradesman had complained he had acquired some bars of silver which had cores of lead to increase the weight so the seller could charge more for them.  The original miner insisted they were of sound quality when he sold them but they had passed through the hands of two separate merchants before reaching the end buyer.

Agricola had the three men taken to different rooms and he went to the first, he said ""If the one who perpetrated this crime admits to it he shall pay a fine of 10 aureus to the man harmed, 10 times the claimed value of the silver bars.  If none of you admit to the crime you shall all be executed.  Now, did you commit the fraud?""

The man thinks a minute before declaring ""I am guilty."" Agricola leaves and goes to the second man and tells him the same.  This man too claims to be the guilty party.  Finally Agricola comes to the third man and gives him the same opportunity to admit to the crime, but this man proclaims his innocence.  Agricola wastes no time in sending his guards to behead the third man, for he knew ""it is he who denied it, that supplied it.""",Jokes,1728629640,nonburnedout,nonburnedout

Are there any downsides to transferring funds from one MMA to another with a higher APY?,"Hey financeheads,

Relatively green when it comes to personal finance. I've had my savings in a MMA for about a year and a half. The APY in my money market account at Byline Bank dropped to 4.27% since the Fed lowered interest rates. I might move my money to OpenBank which has an APY of 5.25% and it doesn't look like there are any hidden fees. I know APY is variable -- is it a strategy to continually transfer funds to banks that have the highest APYs to maximize my yield? Or is it best to just ride it out because it'll go up again. 

Thanks

Never healed from burnout and got a full time job. Advice? Leave or go back to school,"I worked and went to school at the same time last year. I should have applied for a student grant that I was aligable for. It would have covered tuition and a new computer cost, but I thought it was a loan that I would have to pay back..so just pure stupidity. I beat myself up everyday because it changed the trajectory of my life. 

Instead I worked and scraped together Pennie's every semester. I got honors, but if I had that money I could've taken time off work to focus on school and received high honors and more grants. I feeel so foolish. On top of this my old job got shut down for mold and it explains the further brain fog and physical stress my body was going through. Plus we didn't get breaks and the higher ups would leave me alone on the floor. I have sunken in eyes and my face lost weight from stress. Customers at my old job said my face looked more anorexic every time he comes in. I was shattered. I did lose a lot of body fat because my old job requires a lot of lifting and walking. I feel like my identity and the peace i had in my skin  has been taken, like my face looks sad in just 1 year. 

I got a full time job now with an hour break, but my body is still not recovered. I got covid last year as well and I still get leg pains and chronic adrenal fatigue on top of the brain fog from the burnout and mold. I've relapsed back into getting panic attacks almost daily since March so over 3 months. The only thing I've tried to help is that I got a red light therapy device and waiting for my health insurance to kick in this month for a new psychiatrist and endocrinologist. But I feel like I need to go on leave. I feel bad because the person that referred me needs me to stay 6 months to get their money. I also, talked to a coworker who's part time for school and I feel like that is more achievable for me. 8 hours a day plus 2 commuting is not the rest my body needs at the moment. I'm so upset my old toxic job got all my energy, and now I have none left for my current one. I just sleep on the weekends and can't move.

Also, I was thinking of going to school either this years intake or next year to finish my diploma in design. I would be entitled to a 8k grant. Plus applying for a buisness grant and scholarships. ",burnedout,1719674105,burnedout,burnedout

Is moving during a burnout a good idea,"Short backstory: I’m 30. My country has been in a housing crisis for a long time, so I still live with my parents. I got offered a rental house.

I have been diagnosed with a burnout. It’s to such an extent where I can’t do anything else than crying and sleeping. I try to work, but it is a just a shill of what I used to do. I’m seeing a psychologist who says this is normal during a burnout.

I went looking for furniture and so today. And then everything became way too overwhelming for me. A voice in my head is asking if all of this is the right time. Can I plan moving out while having a burnout? How can I do everything needed, if I have so little energy and I can’t focus on anything?

I am bothered by gfs ex thing,"I was trying to find something related or close to what I am going through on here so I could find answers but I cannot. I need advice. 

My gf (f30) and I (f29) have been together almost 2 years. We have had a lot of issues, boundaries set because of certain ppl in our past, mistrust, and drama. 

This guy, let's call him Herbert. (30m) Herbert was her ex fling. Not a real relationship. Herbert has no job, cannot drive, stinks, and is basically a loser. Herbert was the thing before me. She lied about who Herbert was and claimed he was just a friend in December of 2022. He texted her often and it was too suspicious. I found out they met on a dating app in March of 2023 and that's where things made sense. During that time, she brought her mom in the picture to lie for her and say Herbert was just a friend. A family friend at that. Basically putting this guy on a pedestal. At the end of it, I stood my ground and I didn't believe Herbert was just a friend. I never did. She was in tears and didn't want to block him but she did. So in September of 2023, everything comes out. She was still secretly talking to Herbert. Even went to his house and he supposedly kissed her but she didn't reciprocate. In October she finally ended the so called friendship and fessed up that they were never friends. It was a fuck buddy but supposedly just oral and hand. 

Fast forward in March of 2024, Herbert texts her from some random number saying he misses having sex in the shower with her. And I'm like ""huh?? You told me you never had sex sex? And that he was never here? And in the shower also?"" I was so distraught and since then I cannot shower with her anymore or use her shower. I just don't. I think of the stuff they did. And what bothers me is she didn't touch me much in the shower but with him, according to his message, she was on his lap, etc. 

I am not a looker but I'm not what that dude is. I have never questioned my looks and I have always been pretty confident. I used to love my average body and how I looked. And I compare and compare.

Anyways, besides not using their sex shower, I cannot go to the bookstore she went with him too or a certain coffee shop. I make an excuse or something. I think she knows why. I want to get past this because yeah I love my gf a lot and after all this stupid bullshit she has put in a lot of effort to make me comfortable. I know she realized her mistakes way too late but I am not perfect either and she has given me chances too. I want to be able to shower with her and adore her body and stuff. But I can't help but think of what that dude said.

What do I do to move past the shower thing and the places? Any advice? Has anyone gone through this?

Text makes it easier to say all kinds of shit we would never say to someone face to face or even over the phone. ",LifeProTips,1728622415,nonburnedout,burnedoutornonburnedout
Can burnout be mistaken for depression?,"Has anyone ever mistaken burnout for depression or can depression come with burnout aswell as social anxiety?
I'm starting to feel like myself again slowly.
I still don't really have interests in the things I love yet but I'm leaving the house more again and I feel ready to get back into work. So I started working again this week. It's like I feel like I can handle how I feel better now. 
I don't feel as low, just more optimistic about things.
For about 4months I've literally just been in my bed watching summer pass me by.
Life didn't feel worth it, I definitely felt depressed and I was scared to step out and be around people. 
I have looked up burnout symptoms and I always wonder if that's what I've been experiencing.
I started going downhill because I was stressed and then missed 2 nights of sleep and worked throughout the night. Once the stress was over I was super tired had fog brain, disorientated and more. After a week wasn't as tired but just was very low in energy and was flooded with negative thoughts and felt like I couldn't physically do things anymore and that I didn't want to be here. I hated myself and started having flash backs of things that happened in the past, even things that shouldnt bother me and hasnt bothered me in a while but seems to bother me when i experience this low state. I spiralled deeper and deeper and felt like i lost control of my mind.
I experience months of this yearly and I'm trying to understand myself more to know how to prevent it and help myself.
I am starting to improve, I am feeling alot more like myself now but still not there yet.
