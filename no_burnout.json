    "body": "I’m a 21-year-old male, and my best friend and roommate is 20. However, there’s an issue between us. He never checks on me, even though I’ve been going through some very serious and traumatic events that have led to depression. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, but my friend seems to lack emotional intelligence. It’s always me who has to initiate contact. Recently, as my depression worsened, he still never asked if I was okay. When I confronted him about it, he said, \"I thought you didn’t need that kind of attention. I figured if you needed something, you'd ask; otherwise, I assumed you were fine.\"\n\nSometimes, I feel like he doesn’t care at all, especially when he sees me in a bad mood. Everyone else asks how I’m doing, but he doesn’t. I know he loves me and wants to help, but I don’t think I can handle his personality anymore. I’m not saying he’s wrong; I understand it’s not fair to expect someone to take care of me all the time. However, I just wish he’d show a little concern. I don’t always have the energy to tell him when I’m feeling bad.\n\nFor example, today I’ve been bedridden with the flu and couldn’t even get up to cook for myself. He didn’t check on me or even ask how I was doing.\n\nI’ve heard a quote that says, \"If you are the person who is always initiating and you start questioning your value in someone's heart, leave them and wait to see if they will notice or not.\" I don’t know if this quote is misleading, but I really need your opinions. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: I (21M) am struggling with my friendship with my best friend/roommate (20M) because he never checks on me, even though I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It feels like I’m always the one initiating conversations, and he doesn’t seem to notice when I’m unwell, even when it’s obvious. I love him and know he cares, but I’m feeling hurt by his lack of emotional support. I heard a quote that says, “If you are always the one initiating, leave and see if they notice.” I don’t know if that’s good advice or not, but I need help deciding what to do. Should I end the friendship?",

    "title": "What to do when my partner's (23M) problems start to be too much for me (22F) to handle?",
    "body": "Me (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been dating for about a year. I love him very much and the relationship itself is going very smoothly, but he's had a hard year – he moved at the beginning of this year and for some time now it has been looking like they'll have to move again (his aunt, who owns the apartment, is unreasonable and frankly just kind of crazy, doesn't take care of the apartment which needs essential repairs and is leaving the tenants in dangerous conditions). \n\nHe's a pretty anxious person and this has been going on for a while, so he's been looking for apartments on and off for several months now, stressing about not being able to find any and at the same time not really knowing if they NEED to find any, as there are a lot of moving pieces and the decision to move isn't final.\n\nOn top of that there's been some other stress factors like changing jobs and finishing school and overall it's been a big year for him and I've done my best to be there to support him and console him in hard times. But I can't help but just feel exhausted at this point. He texts me something new about the moving / apartment hunting every single day and I don't even know what to say anymore. I feel like we're just ALWAYS talking about this, and I understand it's important to him and I'm supposed to be his support, but I need space to breathe too.\n\nIs it bad of me to expect to lay some of the weight of his problems on someone else as well, like his friends or family? I kind of feel like when he hangs out with his friends, they tend to just get high and have fun, and then I'm there for all the hard stuff. I see it as a privilege to be the person he confides in the most, but it's just a lot.\n\nShould I just grit my teeth and accept that supporting your partner no matter what is a part of a relationship? Or should I communicate this in some way? I've never been in a relationship this long so I'm a bit lost.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend's had a stressful year and I'm doing my best to be there for him, but being his main support for everything is starting to exhaust me. Do I have a bad mindset or should we talk this out?",

    "title": "22f and 23m navigating a complicated friendship",
    "body": " \n\nthis is going to be a long one. Im 22(f) and he's 23(m). I will call him Skylar (this is a fake name)  this is our second summer knowing each other. I got a job in Alaska last summer and met him then, and we both came back this summer for another season. he just got out of an extremely toxic relationship that lasted four years, partially with the help of me. and at the end of 2023 I got out of an abusive year long relationship. \n\n we shared the same off day this summer and we're the only two people who had that day off, so naturally we hung out. I didn't interact with Skylar outside of work much last summer bc his ex also worked for the same company and he lived in different housing then. so Ive really only gotten to know him in these past 6 months. and it's been a rollercoaster of a time. \n\nAt the beginning of may he is showing me messages almost every day from his ex saying how much she hates him and doesn't want to be with him . He keeps telling her that they aren't together . He only wasn't blocking her because she crashed his car and no one was telling him anything about it . he also had to go home for a white to deal with the car ( but that trip is a story of its own ) Everyone around us was saying how cute we looked together but we were just two friends hanging out and getting to know each other. We would stay up most nights just talking. \n\nThere are two coworkers (and they are a couple) I need to introduce, we will call them Ed and Sarah (these are fake names) Everything started after Sarah got back from her week long vacation and this overlapped with Skylar's trip back home to deal with his car and bank issues he was having.  I am the lead of the department I work for and Ed got the opportunity to become my assistant... He overstepped so much in his role and was on a power trip, so much so that I had to have a meeting with Ed and two of our bosses. \n\nDuring the meeting , the boss and I were just sitting there and the second boss was talking at Ed. He was telling Ed how he needs to stop focusing on the negatives of everything because he's getting too worked up about things that simply don't involve him. Everyone's moods would shift because Ed would get irritated over the smallest things. It was weird because every response Ed had he some how had to bring Skylar into it.  Ed was hyper fixated on everything Skylar was doing Even after the meeting we could not  figure out what his obsession with Skylar and me was about and it only got worse after this meeting. \n\nThe next day the boss came up to me and checked on me. I told him it was a rough day even after the meeting. and the boss told me that Ed either needs to change his attitude or else he will get demoted. This is when Ed just started spiraling. He and Sarah started to cause a lot of drama in our lives because they got in contact with Skylar's ex girlfriend. \n\nlong story short... for this part lol... ed, sarah, and his ex were harassing both me and skylar everyday for over a month both online and in person. I was getting death threats and my appearance and mannerisms hated on by all of them, simply because I was being a friend to skylar and trying to help him better his life.  And don't get me wrong, Skylar has his own set of issues and thats why I'm making this post. but it was just constant, for an example, skylars ex called him 107 times in one day. we just ended up turning our phones off most days during this time because we couldn't handle the constant harassment. \n\n\n^^ end of background information.\n\nI think the fastest way to get this Information out is by a list. These are some of the events that have happened:\n\n-skylar has unblocked and blocked his about 6 times in the 4 months we've been getting harassed (one of them being today... I saw a chat with her and he gave the same excuse... But the conversation was him saying that he wants nothing to do with her and that she needs to stop making new accounts and contacting him) \n-he has gotten annoyed when I dance with friends, on multiple occations\n- he gave me edibles after i asked if they were edibles... He said no they were plain... I had a panic attack when i woke up high after the nap... he said it wasnt intentional \n-hes given his ex money bc he feels bad for her when she didn't have much... She was dependent on him. and that was only one time this summer.\n-ive cried multiple times because of stuff he's said to me \n\nAnother side note is that even though we don't label the relationship, we act like a couple. We do all the things and he has been so patient in that regard. He's been the first person I've hooked up with since certain things occurred. He also has stated that he wants to be more than friends but his actions with engaging with his ex make me hesitant to start that. \n\ni feel like im missing so much but my biggest issue is the lying and engaging with his ex who made our lives hell this summer. i have chosen to forgive him for a lot of the things that have happened. i am only at this job for three more weeks then I fly home. He is deciding to only go back to his home state for two weeks to see his child siblings and this grandfather. But other than that he has nowhere to go. At one point i was offering a unit my brother rents out or a room in my parents house that he could rent from them, both options are cheaper than anything other apartment. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm a highly anxious person and overthink a lot, I also deal with depression so I'm just trying to figure out if I'm overthinking any of rhis. For some reason I just can't walk away. I care about this man so much and i don't know if its at my detriment. I just need advice on what I should do. Do I cut him off in three weeks when I leave this job (that would be devastating to us both) or do I continue to make this friendship work? \n\nLet me know if there needs to be any clarification on anything, any advice is appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: A 22-year-old woman, recently out of an abusive relationship, developed a close friendship with a 23-year-old man named Skylar, who is recovering from a toxic four-year relationship. They faced intense harassment from his ex and two coworkers, leading to significant stress. Although they act like a couple, Skylar's ongoing contact with his ex and some troubling behaviors have created doubt. She feels conflicted about whether to cut ties after leaving their job in three weeks or continue the friendship, despite the emotional turmoil. She seeks advice on how to proceed.",

    "body": "I've been dating Mike for about 3 months, and I really like him, but everyone around me dislikes him. We started our relationship while I was getting to know someone else. He messaged me on Instagram every day, even after I set boundaries. He sent me a selfie and asked if I was a racist (we're of different races). When it was my birthday he didn’t even wish me happy birthday \n\nThe first time we met, he wanted me to watch his game, but I had other plans, he begged me to come and to see me after. I invited him to a friend's house where we were making pizza and watching a movie. After his game, a girl jumped on him (she had her arms around his neck and his legs around his waist), and he said she was his cousin,(that was not his cousin) he asked me to meet him by the school hall and left me waiting on him from almost half an hour. Later, he came to the house, was rude to my friends, refused to talk to my friends, shushed my bsf and made a comment about one of my other friend not wearing a bra.\n\nWe always get into arguments when it comes to girls and his habit of lying and during our arguments he always mentions that he left another girl he was talking to for me. For example I made I joke about him always being the first person to like a girls photo and he went nuts and accused me of being jealous and when I asked him not to let girls like jump at the his final game he flipped and again and then I said I wasn't coming. \n\nI came anyways he ignored me the whole time, and when he finally came to talk to me, he just asked if I was going now because he was and then he walked away. I tried opening up to him about feeling ignored that day and that I understand that he was excited that he won, but I felt like he didn't want me there. He said it was because he feels awkward around his teammates and coaches and that’s why he didn't want them to meet me.\nHe also said he was sorry his parents were looking for him\n\nHe asked me if I was going to a music festival and I said I was. He said he was coming then because I was gonna go. When I asked him a week before if he has going he said no because he is going on a sports tour to another country the weekend after the festival (they didn't even have tryouts yet). He asked me so come outside so see him because he was going away for a week without a kiss (I see this guy twice a month maybe). He said his parents were out of town so he can't really go out. On the day though he went to a pub to go play pool with his friends and stood me up for a second time.\n\nWe had a big argument about this and midway through the argument he asked me if I was going to his friend's prom's after party at a lodge. I got more upset because I told him multiple time no, because my mom is strict and I write my igcse math exam 3 days later. I reminded him of this and he said his friends (who I have met or spoken to) said it's because I'm a racist. He made a joke and told them that I don't like black people, I only like brown people.\n\nHe nitpicks my texts messages, if I don’t send a bunch of heart emojis after every text or only refer to him using pet names he flips out and asks I'm mad again. I also feel like he's cheating because he texted me randomly and basically said that a girl pulled him away and asked him about his friend Andrew because she was a crush on him, people were walking by and said\n\"mikes cheating\" because they had a crush on each other last year. I found that interesting because my bsf’s  asked her cousin who is friends with Mike about him and I. He said he had no idea he even had a girlfriend.\n\nTDLR: I don’t know if I should break up with my boyfriend ",

    "title": "My 22F boyfriend 23M feels bored of me and the relationship. We have been together for 2 years. Should I try to put in the effort to be more fun or leave?\n\n",
    "body": "Hello, I came here after my bf and I recently had a long discussion about our relationship.  \nWe have been living together for almost 2 years. We moved in together after 5 months of dating. He is currently depressed and under medication. He has been feeling this way for 3-4 months already. I didn't know anything and only found out randomly from his friend when he asked him if he is feeling bad anymore. I got very hurt because I felt like he didn't trust me enough to tell me how he has been feeling.  \n  \nWe also don't have sex as often anymore, only like once every 4-5 days at best. And all week I've been going to him to get some attention, cuddle, get some love but he always refused me. This morning I got mad at him and said I would stop being so needy and stop asking for attention. He noticed right away, he even came up to me and acted like he wants to have sex and I refused him. I felt used and mad, he didn't even want to cuddle all week and now he wants my body. That started our fight. I asked him what's wrong and he finally said he is bored. That he doesn't desire me anymore because I don't initiate sex at all. He said that even if I go to him and kiss it's not enough. That he doesn't feel the spark anymore, and he wants me to have a spark, that he wants passion. I proceeded to ask him what kind of passion he means and he was pretty vague. Said that passion can be felt in my attitude and I don't have it. I don't bring excitement. He also said he doesn't want a granny and I act like one.\n\nA bit about myself, yes I don't initiate sex because I have this issue where I can't concentrate on it. I only had one orgasm from someone else my whole life and it has nothing to do with him. I just can't get in the moment even if I'm in the mood. Also, I am passionate, just for different things. I am going through a period when I like staying by myself a lot. I paint, I love nature, I draw, I watch stuff, I sing, I cook and clean, go to college and go to work. And I find pleasure in it. I get very excited about some of these things and it brings me joy. I am content. I am also a very bubbly girl, I'm not sad a lot, I just love life. Not the most sociable but I am trying to find friends.\n\nI got very hurt when he called me a granny and said he is bored. I asked him how he envisions a passionate relationship and he didn't want to further elaborate. I guess we grew a bit comfortable with each other and I didn't really initiate going out since I haven't been feeling like it. I just don't know how to go further about this. Also, he doesn't shower as often as I would like and I'd really hate to tell him that. I just don't want to initiate sex if he hasn't showered.  \n  \nI don't know if I can offer him what he wants to be honest but I still love him.  Also I am afraid that he is depressed because of the relationship because even though he loves me he used to date a lot. A lot of his serotonin and will to live came from the excitement to date people and have sex with them.  (He has a narcissistic past but he is better now)\n\nWe had discussions before about the fact that he is bored and we even discussed going into an open relationship or taking a break to solve it but I realized it's not what I want and gave up on it. I don't know how to act, I thought maybe I am too nice to him, always at his call and beck and that maybe I should stop and it will make things better, but I don't want to hold back my love if that's what I feel like.  \nHe also never comes up to me to talk, only tells me when it's too late and if I ask him numerous times what's wrong.  Should I try to put in the effort to be more fun and exciting or leave him to find what he is looking for?\n\n**TLDR:** My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost two years, but things have gotten difficult recently. He's been struggling with depression, which I only found out through a friend, and our relationship feels distant. He says he's bored and that I don’t bring enough passion, which really hurt me. I love him, but I'm unsure how to give him what he wants, especially since I've been content with my own hobbies and life. I'm worried about where this relationship is heading, and I don't know what to do next.\n\n",

    "body": "My (25F) friend and roommate (26F) recently dropped off a letter to me detailing why I am a bad friend, and it has left me feeling extremely hurt and confused. \n\nWe have been friends for 10 years, and roommates for two years. Things between us started becoming tense when I started dating a new man (35M), about two months ago, who is now my boyfriend. At the same time I started seeing him more, I also picked back up a longtime hobby of soccer, and play two times a week. Through this, I have also met more people that I have been spending time with. \n\nAdmittedly, I haven’t been home as much. I work from home full time, so at the end of the day I’m itching to get out. My roommate works in the office and so our schedules are pretty different. I thought my not being home wasn’t a big deal, but my roommate became increasingly upset, and would resort to silent treatments, being short with me, and even removing photos we have with each other from the house. \n\nI decided to ask her what was wrong about a month ago. She claimed that she was just going through a tough period and had some health scares. Things returned to normal for about a week, and then the sulking, silent treatment, etc continued. I figured it was just her personal problems again, and continued on as normal until things became so uncomfortable that I asked her again last week if everything was okay. She gave me the “A-Okay” symbol, and that was it. I then texted her once she left and told her we needed to sit down and talk, clearly something is wrong and I’m confused. We agreed to talk a few days later when we were both free.\n\nShe then drops off a letter and tells me she doesn’t have the mental capacity to talk about things right now. I told her that I will read the letter, but it’s still important that we talk. \n\nSo, I read the letter. It is a scathing detail of how I have abandoned my friends for a new relationship and don’t uphold my household duties. I was shocked. \n\nNot only is it confusing, but her narrative is completely different than mine. Sure, I am spending more time with my boyfriend, probably about 2 times a week, but I also looked back on the past two months to double check, and I have actually hung out with her and our mutual friend group 5 times. I have invited her to two outings with our mutual friends and she doesn’t show up. I’m really confused on where she has built this narrative from because to me, I haven’t abandoned anyone. I’m still spending a good chunk of time with my friends, and on top of that meeting new people and starting a hobby again. As far as the household duties go, I am also confused. We are both cleanly people and I routinely take the trash out, vacuum, put dishes away, and clean up my mess. It has never been an issue between us before.\n\nShe basically ended the letter saying she can’t support me anymore and can’t continue being disregarded. I’m really trying to see things from her perspective, but I’m also extremely hurt by the things she said in the letter and the way she handled the situation. We are going to talk eventually, but trying to gather my thoughts has been overwhelming to say the least. \n\nHow should I go about sticking up for myself and communicating with her, while still keeping in mind she is also hurt?\n\nTL;DR My (25F) longtime friend and roommate (26F) sent me a letter out of nowhere telling me she doesn’t want to be friends anymore.",

    "title": "I caught feelings to quickly and now idk if this guy is truly in a depressive episode or just not into me anymore",
    "body": "Ok so I (20F) met this guy (23M) about 3 weeks ago. Ik it hasn’t been long, but bear with me because this whole situation is kinda confusing and idk what to do. \n\nWhen I first saw this guy, I thought “omg he’s exactly my type” but also thought there was no way I would ever actually get a chance with him. We swapped instagram’s and I thought that was that. But then he dm’d me the next day, was super flirty, and over the next few times we had set up a day to hangout. \n\nThis is honestly part of where I think things may have gone wrong, because both of us only ever referenced them as “hangouts” and never “a date”. But in my eyes, it totally was a date. He drove to my place to pick me up, came to the door, took us to coffee and paid, then took me to watch the sunset and the buffalo at a nearby lookout. Am I crazy for thinking that’s a date?\n\nWe hung out for 5 hours, and only stopped because I had to get ready for work. During our time he had even mentioned other fun “hangout” ideas like taking me golfing and teaching me how to snowboard later on. He also said that it’s been a while since he’d done this with someone, in reference to our hangout. When I got back home he was already texting me how much fun he had and that he can’t wait to see me Sunday since we had already planned to hang that day as well. \n\nThe next 2 times we hung out over the course of 2 weeks, it truly was just a hangout. I went over to his place and we watched football and ate dinner. The last time I’ve saw him he had invited me over to spend the night because we had to be at the same place the next day, and he said we could just carpool. \n\nAll during the while, I’m over here catching some feelings probably way too fast. He’s a very physically affectionate person—which I love,— has the exact same type of humor as me, all of our mutuals have nothing but good things to say about him, and he’s just my type. \n\nBut that morning after I spent the night is where I’m not quite sure what happened. When I woke up, my mom called because she needed help moving boxes out of storage, and he had a haircut appointment as well, so we both split up and said that we would just see each other later that night during our event. I could tell vibes were a little off that morning. He didn’t seem as energetic as he usually did, and wasn’t joking with me half as much as previous times. But I brushed it off at the time.\n\nWhen we got to our event though, I felt as if he was acting like he didn’t even know me. He had mentioned previously when we were together that personal and professional life was a hard line that he always kept separate. So I did contribute some of that coldness to the fact that we were in a work environment and he was busy doing his job, but still I couldn’t help but get a little whip lash and the utter nothingness I was getting out of him. Ik it’s an extreme jump, but I’m an over-thinker, and all of our interactions at this time definitely made me felt like he was just not that into me anymore.\n\nThe event spanned over 3 days. Typically we’re both not very fast at responding over text as both of us have very busy lives (some days he literally has work and school from 4am - 7pm) but during these days my texts went unanswered for at least 8 hours, and sometimes it even took days when it hadn’t been like that previously. \n\nSome of his friend that were there with us had mentioned to me that his vibes were definitely off and moral seemed low, so I thought to check in at least. After the event was all wrapped up, I did reach out and ask him if he was doing ok. \n\nHe told me: “I’ll be honest not good. But in a way of if I just need to ride the wave and it’ll get better with time and there’s not a lot else that can happen. I appreciate you’re checking up on me, means a lot”\n\nThis did soothe a little bit of my nerves about the whole thing. It’s just that ever since then, I’m lucky to get a response twice a day. I know that if he’s in a bad mental state rn, then texting honestly might just be hard rn. My problem is I have no idea where I stand at the moment. \n\nWe have never said anything was a date previously, so are we even dating? We’ve been doing domestic stuff together when I’m at his place and we’re just chilling, but both of those times we did end up sleeping together. So is this just fwb?? \n\nI have never had a serious relationship. He is the second guy I’ve ever slept with, and he is also the first guy that I could see something more serious with. My standards are high and I refuse to settle, so actually being with someone who has checked all of my boxes is crazy for me and I don’t want to lose him in whatever capacity that may be. \n\nIf he’s in a depressive episode right now, I want to be there for him, but because I’m not sure where we stand, I’m not sure what I can do that wouldn’t be overstepping. Because of all that I’ve kinda left the ball in his court. If he wants to hang out, I’ll let him ask. I want everything to be out of his willingness and not because he feels pressure if I ask. \n\nRight now in my head I’m just trying to emotionally detach I guess. All of my friend have said that I haven’t known him long, and that they’ve been played this way before too. When a guy say they have something going on but are just hiding the fact that they’re losing interest. \n\n**TL;DR; : What do I do from here? I’ve only known this guy for a month, I’ve already caught feelings, but now idk if he’s genuinely doing bad mentally or just needs an excuse. Do I just keep texting with him and see if he gets better eventually and asks me out again? But then idk how long that will take. And is it weird to hold out hope and wait that long for someone who I essentially haven’t even known that long? Or do I take this as a sign that I should just let it fade out and it was only ever a fwb situation for him?",

    "body": "\nOkay so messy incoming but the bullet points are essentially “Sally” had a huge crush on me at the start of our friendship 3 years ago. We were “talk every few weeks hang out in groups friends” etc. about a year in she made a move on me after we hung out 1:1 for the first time in months (I was interested, but she told me she couldn’t do a long term relationship with anyone as she was maybe moving in two months for career) I declined her advances as I don’t like casual hookups with friends, and she distanced herself after this. We didn’t talk for two or 3 months, her job offer unfortunately fell thru, we reconnected. I reproached if there was still interest, she said she had gotten over it, and hoped we could remain friends. Two months later we kept hanging out and seemed closer so I reasked, and she told me she was for sure over it and saw me like a brother now. I agreed to stay friends but backed off a bit.\n\nWe both started seeing someone casually, and went back to casual talk every few days/ every other week friends, maybe hung out alone once or twice a few times that summer.\n\nBoth of our relationships ended around July, and she really took the initiative in being my friend. She would FaceTime me every day we were both free, text me plans, group dinners etc. for the past 3 months, most of her friends would act like they thought something was happening between us, though a mutual friend told me she didn’t feel like there was anything there. \n\nExcept a lot of the contact has crossed wires with me again and I feel the need to talk to her about it. She’s started cooking me food weekly, whenever I make plans in the group or plan on things she interjects and says “what are we doing” even if it’s something she doesn’t want to do, or “do we have plans this weekend/tuesday”?\n\nStarted asking to come over after work 2-3 times a week and stopping by my apt to cook dinner together, we have tv shows she only wants to watch with me, couple activities just the two of us should do(Apple picking etc). I have no problem doing stuff 1:1 with my girl friends, but the amount of the contact and activities is over the platonic line for me (and every single one of my 3rd party girl friends has told me this as well)\n\nI wasn’t sure I was uncomfy until she bought me concert tickets this past week for a fairly intimate show this past weekend, and then when I told her I’d Uber us home as I was tired she asked me to walk her home instead of ubering us and took me to a park she wanted to go to and walked us on a walk on the beach and kept asking me if I was sure I wanted to not stay out,then started planning an out of state trip for the two of us, alongside leaving the country on vacation next year with just us two and a mutual couple friend, and then she kept invading my personal bubble (I’m not a touchy person at all, she isn’t really either so this made me uncomfortable)\n\nI’m big on boundaries so I’ve been really strict on myself to not flirt act inappropriate etc but now she brings up sexual topics we had talked about years ago “remember when you told me you were into doing X lmao” and stuff like that. But I don’t know a good way to bring this up or have this conversation? In any other circumstance I would ask her for dinner because I would view this as interest past platonic, but I’ve already been shot down twice so it feels inappropriate to ask her. Is there a healthy way to talk about this? Or could someone maybe help me with a “script” of sorts? I care about our friendship but I want to find a partner and our friendship has already crossed that “closeness” to me that if either of us start dating someone seriously I will need to exit or back out significantly to not be emotionally cheating.\n\nTLDR: girl who’s rejected me is now buying me concert tickets and cooking dinner for me, planning trips, and other things. I want to talk to her about this but not sure I can find the words to do so",

    "body": "\ni work full time, model and take care of my home. my girlfriend recently moved in with me and i feel like she doesn’t try to carry any weight. i do everything out of love but at times i’m feeling like she’s being ungrateful. i pay the bills, wake up at 5 am to drive her to work before i go to work myself, take a late lunch to bring her home after her shift and head back to work then cook dinner and spend the evening with her. recently, she’s been upsetting me. \n\nsituation 1:\ni’m sick (bad allergy cold) but on the way home from work, i grocery shopped and cooked us dinner. i spent the whole evening watching love island with her rather than hang with my friends on the game (she knew i blew them off for her). the next morning i woke up hungry but wanted to hang with my friends before our busy day. i made our coffee and asked if she could reheat my food from the night before for me while i hopped online. she said “give me 30 minutes, i’m not hungry”. i waited 2 hours until i went in my room and she’s on the phone and doing her nails. i reheated my food and went to sit down and she yells “can you bring me a napkin for my toes??”. i said “i’m eating”. she came out and said “you could’ve brought me a napkin you were right there. now i messed up my toes and have to redo them”. she said i was being spiteful by not getting her napkin and that she planned on warming it up after her nails but didn’t know she was being clocked for time to get my food to me in exactly 30 minutes. all i asked was that she communicated this rather than let me wait 2 hours. on top of this, the other day we got into a petty disagreement and afterwards she made herself dinner and nothing for me. it’s just a lack of consideration to me.\n\nlast night, i asked her in what ways does she feel that she goes out of her way for me or how does she try to make things easier for me and she was silent for a whole minute until she said “i clean sometimes”..\n\ni lightly brought up how she seems ungrateful because one of the other things she does is complain if i don’t do absolutely everything for her. for example, i take my lunch late everyday to pick her up from work then i head back to work. she grabbed a couple groceries while at work and i let her carry the bags from the car to the door (like 4 of them) and she got upset and said “i’m so tired, my feet hurt and i’ve been working all day. you could at least be carrying these” so i carried half of them. \n\nfinally, last night, she asked me if i’d like her to make me a bagel before work and i said yes. she didn’t. she doesn’t even wake up to say bye to me before i head to the office. \n\ni hope i’m not over exaggerating or being too hard on her but i’m exhausted and starting to feel taken advantage of. i have a lot to offer financially, i have a wonderful job and i am admittedly attractive and moving up in my modeling and now acting career. my family and friends all tell me i need to watch out for myself in regards to being used by people and i’m just unsure at the moment. before she got here it was all “i’m going to take care of you” but now she doesn’t go out of her way in a thoughtful manner for me in the slightest these days. other than wanting to be intimate. in turn, i’m finding it hard to be intimate and she’s complaining about that as well despite still not changing her behavior.\n\nTLDR:\nFor context, we met when we were kids, dated on and off and officially moved in together now. My girlfriend recently moved in and puts in very little effort or consideration into our cohabitating. How do i get her to finally see my side and show a little consideration?\n ",

    "body": "Without much context on our relationship, we've had a lot of ups and downs but still would like to make things work. Over the weekend, I (F29) felt really badly about him forgetting a detail about me: how tall I am. We've been together for a little under 1.5 years and it's come up a number of times. He immediately jumped to defend himself, as a way of trying to make me feel better, but instead just made me feel worse (i.e.: \"I don't remember ANYONE'S height). It was also while we were at a date that I planned, which made me feel even worse. He didn't apologize till we got home, over an hour later, and we talked it through. I could tell he didn't really understand, but he was trying. It was fine. He needs to write things down to remember them and I'm supportive of that. It's just that I *felt* bad and wanted to be held and sincerely told that he will try next time, because it was important to me.\n\nWe go through the next few days per normal: cooking dinner, eating together, watching TV, going to the gym. On Wednesday, after a super minor (but normal) interaction that made me feel off, I told him that it made me feel a little misunderstood, and that I think I'm realizing that after we have arguments, we might need to do something to break out of a routine.\n\nHe jumped to, and he's done this before, how \"he's always dating me.\" That the time we spend around the house, walking to the gym, going to the gym, eating together, is an intentional choice that he makes on a daily basis. While I understand this notion, I think where I was getting at was that while that was also really important for me to maintain our relationship, I felt like I had a hard time jumping right back into the day to day things we do after an argument because I like to reset with a super special, out of the box activity that we can do together. It could be as simple as baking together, or going somewhere to play pool for an hour maybe.\n\nHe ended up getting sad. He felt like I didn't value your quality time enough to make me happy and therefore, what's the difference between that and him playing video games or hanging out with friends, if it didn't matter to me? I told him that while it did matter to me, it had more to do with how to make myself feel better. He then proceeded to say, \"ok, I guess we can do a date night after things like that happen\" while visibly still remaining upset. In fact, he wouldn't make eye contact with me at all. He said he won't be sad later, but at this point, I feel guilty about voicing how I felt and it just felt like the whole situation devolved into him feeling like the time he's spending with me is undervalued on a day to day basis because it's something he could be spending elsewhere, and felt like it was underappreciated it.\n\nI tried to tell him that wasn't the case. Nothing I said could change the way he felt about it. He was still sad. I told him that if he wanted to do those \"other\" things, he should, but he should also be open to it if I ever told him that I wanted to spend time with him. He never really takes well to these conversations. It feels like the solution should never be to stop sharing altogether, but literally nothing I say, no matter how I say it, changes his perspective on things at all. It's really sad. I feel super disconnected from him as a result.\n\nWhat am I missing from a communication style standpoint?\n\nTL;DR I'm having a hard time talking to my boyfriend, seems like all we do is make each other upset.

    "title": "My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) are having many arguments and are bad at communicating. What to do? ",
    "body": "\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We met at a bar almost 2 years ago and started off as friends and had lots of fun together. We went on a trip and our relationship developed further starting then. \n\nThe first months were all good, and even moved in together. It was going good, up until a certain point where I started to question our relationship and him as well. That was around the same time my parents would bring up stuff about him they didn't like. \n\nMy parents didn't like some of the things he would do (forget to put his chair in place at the table, forget his glass of water on the counter etc.). He also had an argument with my mom where he was super respectful and my mom not really. \n\nMy mom started feeling resentful towards him from that point and compared him a lot to my ex (which she likes a lot) which is something I do not agree with. I agreed with my bf in regard to the argument they had, but noticed that since then, I feel a lot of resentment towards him as well, which I know is not right.\n\nI realized at that point that I tend to be super influenced by my parent's opinions in general and that I'm figuring myself out in this time and that it's okay not to agree with them all the time, and that I'm my own person. I also realized that I love my parents and would have liked for them to like my boyfriend but that it's my life, therefore my decisions and can choose someone for myself. \n\nThe thing is, since then, I noticed I tend to get super attentive to any little thing my boyfriend would do wrong and that I didn't like and had trouble choosing my battles. And would fight for stupid things with him. Some of them were fair battles to me, but some I agree weren't. And they're things I wouldn't normally bicker about. Along the way, he wasn't helping our arguments, as he wasn't very validating towards my feelings and could be disrespectful (name calling, raising his voice, sarcasm). I tend to be on the emotional side and he tends to be more rational. But the invalidating and disrespect did not help my resentment and feel he could have developed some towards me as well. I started feeling super insecure towards myself and our relationship. \n\nHe started blaming all of our problems on me, and that didn't help my insecurities and resentment. At a certain point, I thought every argument was truly all my fault. I started seeing a therapist a few months ago and she truly helped me build my confidence and be more self-aware. She made me realized I have ADHD, hypersensitivity and trouble with calming my anger. She also helped me identify some childhood traumas that affect the person I am today and that I have a lot to unpack. I got better. \n\nBut my boyfriend and I still had fights that would escalate for nothing and were on the verge of breaking up for a few times. We realized that it was all super toxic for both of us, but that we loved each other very much and are willing to try to make it work. He suggested we see a couples therapist, and have been seeing her for 7-8 sessions (1 every 2 weeks). He realized he also had issues on his end, such as controlling his anger as well, and being more kind in his words, in the way he is talking. And that he indeed had a role in our fights escalating. He also wants to start seeing a therapist on his own.\n\nThe couples therapist did help with some things, but we still have ups and downs. \n\nThe thing is, I feel like we both have a lot of resentment and anger built up due to all the fights we had. We love each other very much, and we want to make it work, but I find it very hard dealing with my own weaknesses as well as his, and I feel he feels the same way. There was no cheating ever on either ends. We hurt each other without wanting to, and feel drained. And our fun moments are more rare than they were, but we still feel the connection and chemistry. \n\nI want it to get better, but find it so hard. Is it supposed to be this hard? Up to when is it fair to fight? How do you get rid of resentment? I truly want honest advice, wether it's in regards to myself or my boyfriend. \n\nTL;DR! My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) are having lots of arguments despite seeing a therapist. What is there to be done? ",

    "body": "I don’t have anyone to talk to this about so hoping that a kind stranger will listen to my struggles. We live about 3 hours away by car from each other, we have been together since March 2024 and we see each other once or twice per month and we try to call every day at the end of the day. There are many issues in different aspects of the relationship, here they are:\n\n1.      I am always the one asking to call at the end of the day. I am always the one asking how he is feeling, how his day is going, etc. Sometimes he doesn’t even ask me the question back and it leads to me having to carry the conversation (on text) all the time. We talked about it and he said he just hates texting and I get it I prefer calling as well but it’s not difficult to simply check up on your partner with a quick text. He also forgets important stuff sometimes and it scares me. Last month (we have been together for 6 months) he asked me how old I was... he forgot my age. I don’t take it personal but what the fuck?\n\n2.      I feel like I am always the one doing all of the planning, finding all of the activities for us to do together. I’m always the one going to visit him (almost 3 hours away by car). He came to my town once this summer. I find it better for me to go visit him anyways because he lives in his apartment and I still live with my family but it’s just the fact that he doesn’t make an effort to plan something or tells me like ‘we should / could see each on this date, etc.’ it’s always me.\n\n3.      He rarely sends me photos of him. I told him that seeing his face cheers me up and he said he would try to send me more pictures but he rarely does it. Maybe 1 picture per month. However, he has no issues posting pictures on his insta. I send him photos of me regularly and if I will post something I always show him the pictures first. I also consistently make an effort to provide him with spicy content because I want to be to able to fulfill that need of his even when I am not around since we see each other once or twice a month. The problem is that he rarely sends me anything in return, it is not something I expect but I would sure appreciate it.\n\n4.      He said he is not comfortable taking photos and videos of himself naked and I understand that but he has sent me some in the past without any issues, we made videos together, etc. He is the first guy that I’ve talked to that doesn’t really want to sext and I’m not sure how to feel about it because I personally love it.\n\n5.      Sometimes, I explain my feelings towards something he has done or didn’t do and he lashes out on me. He takes it personal. On the moment he gets so heated up and cannot control his reactions. I never insult him, I never use curse words, (he doesn’t either) I only use ‘I’ statements to express myself, I don’t put the blame on him, so why does he react like this? I even explained this exact situation to him and told him it makes me scared to talk to him about how I feel certain times and he lashed out again. I just don’t get it.\n\n6.      Sometimes he has really bad mood swings during the day when we are together in person. He becomes unpleasant out of nowhere and I have a really hard time understanding what is causing it. We have talked about it and he also apologizes when that happens before I leave to go back home and I always tell him I just wish I could understand what is causing it so I could help him improve those mood swings.\n\nThe majority of our time spent together in person is great and I enjoy every moment of it. We have similar values and goals for the future. We know what we want and we have made it clear to each other. I love him deeply for who he is and who he is working towards becoming.\n\nI know it takes time to change and if we zoom out we haven’t been together for a very very long time yet so, what else could I do about all of this?\n\n**TLDR:** I’m mostly the one initiating communication, planning our meetups, and putting in effort to stay connected, but my boyfriend doesn’t really reciprocate the same way. He forgets important things, like my age, and rarely shares photos, despite me asking. While he doesn’t feel comfortable with sexting, which I understand, I still feel disappointed. He sometimes lashes out when I express my feelings, making it hard for me to communicate openly. He also has unpredictable mood swings. Despite all this, I love him deeply, and our time together in person is mostly great, but I’m unsure how to handle these issues.",

    "title": "Girl told me (28 F) that bf (30 M) said he’s single. She was lying but my trust is still shattered. What should I do? ",
    "body": "TL;DR: I was insecure at the start of the relationship and resulted in my bf hiding things from me. I have since gone to therapy and made a lot of improvements. We agreed that we will both be fully transparent and I’ll manage my own emotions. However since then I have discovered two instances that boundaries were murky between him and females. One time was a colleague who sent flirty messages, and the other time was an old crush. I feel like my trust is broken, and now I’m stuck feeling anxious and heartbroken. \n\n——-\nHi everyone, tricky situation here so grateful for your patience. Here it goes:\n\nWhen we first started dating, my boyfriend was an excellent bf, he would show me texts from other girls if he suspected they had other intentions, and invite me to help him craft responses. However, I struggled with retrospective jealousy, and every conversation ended with me in tears. This eventually led him to stop telling me. \n\nI’ve since then done a lot of work with therapist, and no longer suffer from retrospective jealousy. However have since discovered bf not shutting down advances from girls e.g., colleagues having a crush on him, and old crush sending him love songs on and off for three years straight. He brushed off these as them ‘fishing,’ assured me nothing is going on, deleting messages wouldn’t letting me read, and blaming things on my jealousy. He admitted liking them as ‘ego boosts’ and wouldn’t eventually shut it down until we have a huge fight. My trust is broken by my bf’s behaviour of deleting texts, not telling me after it was agreed upon, entertaining attention from this girl for years (he admitted they were ‘ego boosts’ for him), and lying to avoid a fight. \n\nFull example below: three years into our relationship, back in February this year, I saw a week-old text notification from the old crush on his phone, which he hadn’t responded to. When I confronted him, he wouldn’t show me the messages but explained that she had started sending love songs again. He said he had deleted the texts and initially hadn’t told me because he didn’t think it was a big deal and didn’t want to trigger my anxiety. I was hurt that he’s not shut her down completely given this is the third year of her doing this, and he promised to tell me &amp; block her if she ever messaged him again. Feeling uneasy, I decided to message her myself (with my bf knowing). She apologized and said they were just long-term friends and nothing more, and even offered to stop messaging if it made me uncomfortable. \n\nLater this year, however, I found out she had messaged him again. My boyfriend tried to cover it up by lying to ‘avoid a fight’, but it only made things worse. Eventually, he agreed to block her on all social media. I should’ve left it but ended up reaching out to her again for clarification, and she claimed my boyfriend had told her he was single. My boyfriend unblocked her to ask why she said that, and she admitted she lied out of anger and blamed me for questioning their friendship. Although the situation was eventually clarified, my trust was still shattered. \n\nMy boyfriend has blocked her again now and agreed to keep his phone open to me, but I’m still heartbroken over this whole thing and struggling to rebuild the trust we once had. Any advice on how to move forward would be really appreciated!\n",

    "body": "TL;DR 26F &amp; 30F - partner doesn’t initiate sex even after being asked to countless times\n\nMy partner and I have been together for 6 years. She’s never had much confidence in herself so I would mostly initiate sex. Earlier on in the relationship she would too. Anyway, I started communicating that I need her to initiate sex too as it makes me feel like shit and not sexy. Every conversation we’ve had about it, it’s been “yep okay I’ll make more effort” and nothing changes. We’ve had this conversation maybe 8/9x in the last 18 months. \n\nGuess what… nothings changed. She doesn’t pursue me, doesn’t try and turn me on before she goes down on me. She just will say “oh do you want something” and then if I say yes, will just start eating me out.. no build up. I broke down to her, cried and told her how upset I was that I was telling her again and again and nothings changing. I thought that convo would be it. I made sure she knew how it was making me feel… thinking she was going to maybe kiss my neck for the first time in 3yrs. \n\nBut nothings changed…. Again. It’s been 2 months since our last conversation and I’m at breaking point. There’s no point in having another conversation with her coz it’s pointless. I’ve started matching her energy, not touching her really coz she never touches me. She thinks I’m being off with her!!!! Which is so ironic. The thing is, I’ve always been more sexually charged than she has and anyone in a dating situation like this.. knows it sucks. She doesn’t know what it’s like to be rejected coz whenever she wants sex, I’m down. But I’m feeling so low about it all that I don’t plan on having sex with her for a long time. \n\nIt’s hard because we’re getting married next year and everything else in our relationship is solid. We don’t argue, we communicate well (apparently most of the time)\n\nI feel like for context, we’re lesbians and the only time she’ll try it on with me is when she wants me to fuck her. She’ll never try and fuck me. \n\nWhat do I do? Do I have another conversation with her? Do I just stop having sex with her until she wants to address it? Has anyone else been through it?",

    "body": "I was trying to find something related or close to what I am going through on here so I could find answers but I cannot. I need advice. \n\nMy gf (f30) and I (f29) have been together almost 2 years. We have had a lot of issues, boundaries set because of certain ppl in our past, mistrust, and drama. \n\nThis guy, let's call him Herbert. (30m) Herbert was her ex fling. Not a real relationship. Herbert has no job, cannot drive, stinks, and is basically a loser. Herbert was the thing before me. She lied about who Herbert was and claimed he was just a friend in December of 2022. He texted her often and it was too suspicious. I found out they met on a dating app in March of 2023 and that's where things made sense. During that time, she brought her mom in the picture to lie for her and say Herbert was just a friend. A family friend at that. Basically putting this guy on a pedestal. At the end of it, I stood my ground and I didn't believe Herbert was just a friend. I never did. She was in tears and didn't want to block him but she did. So in September of 2023, everything comes out. She was still secretly talking to Herbert. Even went to his house and he supposedly kissed her but she didn't reciprocate. In October she finally ended the so called friendship and fessed up that they were never friends. It was a fuck buddy but supposedly just oral and hand. \n\nFast forward in March of 2024, Herbert texts her from some random number saying he misses having sex in the shower with her. And I'm like \"huh?? You told me you never had sex sex? And that he was never here? And in the shower also?\" I was so distraught and since then I cannot shower with her anymore or use her shower. I just don't. I think of the stuff they did. And what bothers me is she didn't touch me much in the shower but with him, according to his message, she was on his lap, etc. \n\nI am not a looker but I'm not what that dude is. I have never questioned my looks and I have always been pretty confident. I used to love my average body and how I looked. And I compare and compare.\n\nAnyways, besides not using their sex shower, I cannot go to the bookstore she went with him too or a certain coffee shop. I make an excuse or something. I think she knows why. I want to get past this because yeah I love my gf a lot and after all this stupid bullshit she has put in a lot of effort to make me comfortable. I know she realized her mistakes way too late but I am not perfect either and she has given me chances too. I want to be able to shower with her and adore her body and stuff. But I can't help but think of what that dude said.\n\nWhat do I do to move past the shower thing and the places? Any advice? Has anyone gone through this?\n\nTL;DR - bothered by things gf did with ex thing and can't do those same things with her anymore",

    "body": "  \nTL;DR: I love my sister but I fear she is enabled by my parents and she wouldn't discuss that. What can I do?? How can I feel less depressed of losing my best friend that is her?  \n  \nI'm a 32 years old female and my sister is 38, we have a very close relationship. Since I was a little kid, we have share many good memories. She taught me about the best music bands, movies, series since I was like 4 and that's why we share a lot of our taste. She was and is very kind towards me, she has never bullied or abuse me in anyway. She studied medicine and I was so happy because that's what I wanted to do later (she was 16 when she chose that path and I was having that kind of dream at 10yo)\n\nWhen I was like 8 I really liked to play tennis but my sister couldn't continue going so my parents took me off of tennis and I was upset but I accepted it. They said it was because \"school and homework was too much for my sister and we can't take you to tennis if she doesn't come\" so I let it go. But I was afraid of my futur as school as it was going to be so hard you don't even have time to do sport. Also, when she started medical school, they bought her a lot of books and equipement and she got an scolarship and thet would take her by car to the college and pick her up.\n\nWhen I started high school I was like \"it wasn't as hard as I expected\" and I was a very good student and very autonomous. I went by bus everywhere and I had great friends that I keep up with today. Then I started medical school and it was very hard but I went trought a 3 months depression that I handled alone and then got in track. I got good grades and made friends and I was moving around by public transportation a lot. I also did sport and prepare my own food. And I started to say stuff \"mom you don't need to drive my sister around by car everywhere, I'm doing the same studies in the same town and we live in the same house, she can go by bus like me\"\n\nBut she kept driving her. Then when my sisted was doing her specialization it got worse because it was like THE hardest part and my parents would even do her laundry. At that time I was busy with my own medical studies but I would do my laundry, my food, even if I didn't pay for it, I would organize me to do it myself.\n\nAll this time my sister and I were in great terms and sharing time together talking at night about music or parties. Then my sister left to Argentina and she stopped working as a doctor, started working at a call center, made a lot of tattoos, became an astrologer and I was like \"do whatever makes you happy, but be careful because economic situation in our country Venezuela is CRAZY, so just do what makes you happy but be autonomous\"\n\nMy mom sent her money, not a lot in general terms, but a lot in Venezuela's context. Like 4000 dollars. And I started to get upset because I, as I'm the younger child and I lived still with my mom, I felt that was household money that we needed.\n\nThen I also left the country and I started helping my mom with her medical conditions. She has a chronic disease and the treatement is not available in Venezuela. I would send the money to my sister and she would buy it and send it. No money was asked to my sister never.\n\nAnd one year my sister said: \"I can't send the medicines. You need to get off my back with that errand. I have my life, my schedules here and can't do as you and mom wish\"\n\nI told her to please reconsider, I told her I could pay extra money to her for her trouble and I would pay the integrity of the treament and the delivery. But she said \"no\"\n\nI asked a friend that lived in Argentina and we did the errand together. Later, my sister was having economic problems and my mom sent her money. After that, she agreed to do the errand of buying the treatement to my mom(that I payed). I think she was mellowed by the fact that my mom sent more money.\n\nShe had no more money to keep living in Argentina, so she went back to our country. My mom payed the ticket. And now they have a lot of very real money issues. Even if she works, it is not enough money.\n\nSo I send a bit of money but I told to my sister everthing that I just wrote. I told her she had every facility and confort and didn't have. I told her it was unfair I have to send money by my own and specially that even if I sent the money, she didn't agree to do the errand for my mom's treament.\n\nShe told me I was so bitter and resentful. She stopped talking to me. My mom told me to not send anything, even if it means she gets sick or bedridden. They said I had no right to judge my sister or my mom. That I was carrying a back of rocks and I was ready to throw them whenever they need help.\n\nI feel so depressed. I haven't speak to my sister in days because she wouldn't answer. I sent money to my mom because she needed them for shoes and she didn't ask but I want my mom to have shoes. I don't know what to do. I felt I hurted my sister beyond reparable and I apologized deeply but she didn't answer. I was doing sports, studying, working and know I have problems to get out of bed or focus. Any advice with this situation?\n\nTL;DR: I love my sister but I fear she is enabled by my parents and she wouldn't discuss that. What can I do?? How can I feel less depressed of losing my best friend that is her?\n\nLenght of relationship: 32 years",

    "body": "I've been in a relationship with my partner (Z) for about eight months now and this has been a continued issue for about half of our relationship. We are both disabled but in different aspects, so we usually fill in the others gaps to keep the house running, but I also have support services to help me (and by extension him) out 4-5 days/week, mainly with domestic help. For specifics that are relevant to this post, we both have ASD, ADHD, C-PTSD and I have fibromyalgia, POTS and several co-morbidities that affects my movement, co-ordination and strength.\n\nThe main issue is that he constantly puts his needs above my own and I'm constantly picking up the pieces. He constantly puts off important things like cleaning, he never cooks (which I knew from day one and was find about as long as he did the dishes on the days I don't get support work to help me) and if I ask him to do something for me, its always put off until the very last second.\n\nEverything has been exasperated because I've recently gotten a service dog to help with my disabilities, which has caused me to rearrange my entire lifestyle to be able to take care of him. I told my partner that I needed him to step up, stop being selfish (his wording that I agreed with, not mine) and to actually help out when I need it instead of spending all day on the computer or reading.\n\nToday, I had plans to do one of my hobbies as I haven't been able to do it for months now (prior to dating Z) and I've finally gotten the equipment I need. I asked him yesterday to clear out the kitchen for me as it's one of my chores I can't complete. I woke up this morning and he was gone to \"find a tree\" and that he'd be back soon. That was 5 hours ago now, and the kitchen still isn't done and I soon have to get started on dinner so I won't be able to do the baking I wanted to do. He also asked me to do a bunch of chores before he left, even though he hasn't done his.\n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened, he has forgotten promises like taking care of the dog so I could have a break (currently introducing him to our other animals and I dont trust leaving them alone just get), putting clothes away, organising the living room of his stuff, bringing washing in etc. On my birthday, he spent most of it locked in the study getting drunk with a friend and didn't understand why I got upset over it, nor why I still am.\n\nI honestly feel more like a mother and a maid to him than a partner. We've had the same conversation multiple times, and nothing seems to change. It's making me begin regret starting up a relationship with him, especially when he prioritises his hobbies, happiness and time with friends over promises he's made me. He's told me outright he's abused partners in the past but has improved his behaviour (which I have seen), and this is my first relationship, so I'm uncertain if I'm seeing red flags or not. \n\nI want to have another discussion with him about how his actions are hurting me and our relationship but I honestly don't know where to begin or if this is even worth saving. How do I go about holding a conversation about this without letting my bitterness of previous actions that he's apologised for jade it?\n\nTL;DR: My partner hasn't been completing tasks as promised, leaving me to pick up the slack. We are both disabled, me more so, and no matter how many times I ask, he won't pick up the slack.

    "title": "I think I just ended a relationship with a narcissist, but I realised too late. We work together, how to manoeuvre myself in the situation from here? ",
    "body": "Hi, as title says. I want to preface this by saying that I am not fully innocent in this situation and I am already aware of that which is partially why I decided to make decisions to end things. I know I am not a perfect person in this situation and I am grappling with those thoughts already, but I genuinely need some advice on what to do because I can’t speak with anyone in my personal life about this situation.\n\nI (21f) entered a relationship with K (39m) approximately 10 months ago. He is a colleague in my workplace who is not directly in my chain of management but is several positions higher than me. When I was fresh to the workplace he made some small efforts to chat to me and one day very randomly hugged me (which is no big deal to me im very friendly and I hug people often). I will point out I am fairly oblivious when people show interest in me because im neurodivergent and not always aware socially at times especially when people show attraction or romantic interest. He offered to drive me home at night because we lived in the same direction and we got a bit closer by sharing about our lives. After a few of these rides home he kissed me. \n\nIt was not until a few nights later that he told me he actually has a daughter and is married. Over the whole course of our relationship I tried to understand more about his marriage and why he would stray, and he of course put blame on her but honestly nothing major or very serious. It was awkward to ask about and usually he tried to change the subject but I did get some information from him. He expressed he wanted to separate but then they found out they were expecting their daughter and decided to stay together. He expressed his dissatisfaction of his relationship with her but felt obligated to stay because of their daughter and the fact he is the only one working. He moved to this country for his career and his wife agreed to follow but never became immersed in the new environment. She does not speak english and because of this feels it would be too difficult for her to work in the same industry she previously worked in when living in her country. Obviously I hear all of this through K’s lens, which I should not fully trust, but he does not necessarily have reason to lie about some things. Even when he told me quite negatively about his marriage I still felt I could empathise with them both. I don’t consider myself a saint, perhaps if I was then maybe I would have cut it off sooner and told her about this, but given his wife’s circumstances I feel she would be unable to leave him anyway and if she tried she could potentially put herself in a really unsavoury position. I mention some of this to highlight cultural difference and also again there is a large age gap hence me and K are in different life stages. \n\nI felt when K told me about his situation that it was not my responsibility to tell him what is and is not “right” and maybe selfishly I just enjoyed being wanted by someone and since I had no personal hindrances I just let things continue. Our relationship eventually grew and became sexual and this was when K told me that he was in love with me. I was very hesitant to let him sleep with me even though sex itself is not a big hang up for me, but he was very adamant and eventually as time passed I agreed. \n\nHonestly, im a little emotionally weak, so when he expressed his deeper feelings for me he had me hooked. Over time I learnt that K has some jealousy issues and some anger management issues. He has quite narrow perspective and was unable to understand how I could interact with males at work and keep things professional while being friendly. He felt my friendliness was “too much” and often got upset with me for even just speaking to others. These men he was jealous of were both staff and customers. I often did not attend group work outings and social events to ensure he was still happy and not upset with me. Yes I did always see how his view was contradictory considering he has a wife but the thing about myself in relationships like this is even if I can notice something unfair, I am easy to walk over and will usually just do as I am told by people to make them happy. \n\nHe expressed that when I was upset or sad or frustrated it annoyed him and he just wanted me to be happy around him and not ruin his mood or our time together. He did not hold himself to the same standard and often spoke with me about his own issues or grievances. Most of his focus on our relationship was sexual. Almost every conversation he would mention something sexual, wanting to sleep with me etc. Even if our conversation topic was completely unrelated. It was flattering but at times very exhausting because it was honestly not the only thing I cared about and I had many other things about our relationship that I thought about and wanted. It felt like if I didn’t give him what he wanted he was disappointed in me, which was truly the most excruciating feeling, and so I did what he asked of me. In return he gave me the affection I craved and obviously filled some emotional satisfaction in the way that he definitely was mending some paternal issues I have (which I feel is obvious given the age difference). \n\nAnyways, to the situation at hand: essentially some coworkers invited me to the beach and I decided to go. I have been trying to cultivate good friendships and not isolate myself anymore. K decided that this was absolutely not okay because 2 colleagues he was particularly jealous about were attending. In no way have these men ever expressed anything other than general friendliness to me, and really have never crossed any line with me at work ever. We also do not speak outside of work so are not close- I went to spend time with one girl I work with in particular who I would like to be better friends with. K was incredibly angry that I was going, and no matter how much I tried to reassure him he had decided that this meant we could not be together since I was being “disrespectful”. I did not allow the conversation to continue much because I did not want to stress myself more than necessary, but this was the first time we argued and I decided I wouldn’t just grovel and do what he wanted. I was already frustrated for something he had done at work (unrelated to me) and was questioning his character after becoming aware of what happened. This argument for me was like the final straw and I ended up expressing we shouldn’t keep arguing while upset. Handling the situation in this manner felt like a big deal for me, as usually I am always on “urgent damage control” and am easy to push around just so that I can calm the other person down-even if it means letting go of my own feelings in the moment. Since I was already feeling upset and a bit disappointed in his behaviour, I think I was able to stand up for myself more in the situation. \n\nThe following evening he sent me a message that read “You do this because you really want to make me mad? Ok I will show you I will do. You will regret” I believe this was in reference to a picture I had posted that I actually took down shortly after because i didn’t really like how I looked. The picture showed some of my body but I wasn’t like fully nude or anything like that. He often was upset at me posting anything of myself, as he was always very protective of me and did not like other people to see me in any way that could deem me “attractive” or “sexy”. K has never really spoken to me like this before, but it caused immense anxiety and I actually had an anxiety attack thinking about the whole thing.\n\nYesterday I returned to work and ultimately tried to avoid him, but he is in a position where at times I am forced to speak with him. When I did have to ask him something, he was ultimately non communicative and very rude to me. He even refused to help me with a customer simply due to how he is obviously mad at me. After our interaction I went to the bathroom to cry because I am unable to handle interactions like this, and the behaviour is very reminiscent of my father and ex boyfriend (both of whom are narcissistic). \n\nI have done a lot of reading in my life about emotional intelligence, different behavioural and psychological issues, and general things about relationships. In my life I am often vulnerable because I am socially behind (again, neurodivergent) so I make effort to keep myself knowledgeable on how to interact with others and how to identify possibly negative behaviours that I may otherwise miss in my life. \n\nThe reason that I note K is narcissistic is because (upon reflection) I can identify many situations and circumstances in which he displays behaviour aligned with narcissistic tendencies. K is unable to regulate his emotions and typically discusses unsavoury situations where he is “innocent” or the “victim”, even when it is clear that perhaps blame could be shared. He often attempted to control my actions and words by commenting on who I was with, what I wore and getting incredibly upset when I was not quick to agree. He seemed to sympathise with me at times but never expressed deep understanding of what I told him about myself, which suggests that he may have a poor ability to empathise with other people. He is quite stubborn and prideful and unable to take any criticism without retaliation. Many times in disagreements he shut me down and refused to let me talk, often mentioning that he will simply leave without discussion even though I made it clear that such a thing would upset me greatly. Conversely, he made a point to drive me home every single day and if I did not go with him he encouraged me to uber to ensure I was going directly home and safely (though I believe his actual intention was to ensure I did not seeing other people.) He also would call me every morning on his commute to work and call me after he took me home, which felt sweet at the time, but if I ever expressed wanting or needing to do something else he would become slightly agitated and ask many many questions. He asked every day if I still love him or miss him or want him, which initially was sweet because I thought it was him being vulnerable but given how excessive it was I can see it for something not so sweet and perhaps a tactic to keep me reeled in emotionally. Obviously I am not a psychologist but I am also not completely stupid so think identifying and mentioning these things is important for context on how K generally behaves and reacts.\n\nNobody in the workplace is aware of our relationship, in fact many people don’t even realise we are friendly outside of work let alone in a relationship. This was purposeful as people are aware of his daughter and wife and he made a point to be quite secretive about our relationship. \n\nI would be lying if I said I didn’t love him, because part of me still does. But I did know that the end of our relationship was inevitable, I just didn’t expect it to happen right now. I have often found myself in the trap of being with narcissist people in my life and I often don’t realise until too late. I understand that in this situation I was the vulnerable one, and the way he treated me at the beginning could be considered grooming in some form. But I am still an adult and need to take on some responsibility also for this situation, I am not completely free of blame I know. Because of my self awareness of not being “innocent” so to speak, I feel I cannot go to anyone for help or advice. \n\nI spoke briefly and without much context with one person who advised me to see HR, but the issue is that actually there has been quite a few big HR issues that I was a witness to. I don’t want this situation to discredit anything I said in separate incidents, because I feel very strongly I needed to stick up for people who were being mistreated. K was also in part related to these other issues, but not at all to myself. Honestly it feels like a big mess but I am stubborn and don’t want to just quit. Threatening me was not a very wise decision, and I do have evidence even though he tried to delete it. Given he is above me in the company he is not in the best position to be talking to me in such ways. \n\nI know that further engaging in conversation with him will just escalate the situation, but given the fact he threatened me I feel I can’t sit by and do nothing. I worry my job may be in jeopardy, but also given I am a lower position in a corporate view point I would not be “responsible” in the same way that K is in the situation. \n\nIf anyone has advice on how to handle this situation, even just advice on how to attempt to work alongside him, I would appreciate it. I am looking for a new therapist closer to my home because I can see how this cycle of relationships like this is damaging to me but am still waiting for an appointment. So in the meantime, reddit was my only option. Sorry if this was long and confusing, I am a bit of a mess. I am posting here instead of in r/breakups because we still have a working relationship as colleagues right now. \n\n\nTL;DR : Ended a relationship with a narcissist 17 years older than me, who I still have to work with and is proving to be difficult to be around. Looking for advice on what I can do to support my emotional wellbeing in this time. ",

She didn’t seem to understand why I was upset and that she will introduce me to people.\n\nShe also hasn’t wanted to me visit her church and vice versa other than it’s too soon.

    "body": "I (29F) have only known my father (53M) since I was 16. My mother (54F), who I no longer speak to for a multitude of reasons divorced him when I was 3 and won full custody. I grew up being told he was gone forever, which I interpreted as dead, until I was told otherwise at 16 when his adult daughter showed up in my life unexpectedly and I suddenly had a whole other family I didn't know about. \n\nThis is where things get complicated. My father lost his wife to cancer 2 years ago when she was 39. His wife was a nice person, but I never particularly felt close to her. My father's and I's relationship was essentially just a quick check in every now and then you until his wife died. Suddenly he wanted a bigger relationship from me, and over the past 2 years I've come to realise that I do not view him as a father, nor care for him more than someone would a casual colleague. I have 2 young kids, and since becoming a mother I just can't fathom as to why my parents never tried harder, and it's made me just realised I'm tired of trying. He's very emotionally draining, and tends to use me as a therapist. He never intentionally hurts me, but he lies a lot to \"protect me\" in very small ways like saying he paid his rego when he really didn't or saying he's not drinking when he has been. We don't live anywhere near each other, so it's not an impact on my life, but it's frustrating as I feel like I'm having to parent him. Whilst I have tried my best, I've come to realise that I don't particularly want a relationship with him, but I don't have a singular good reason to end the relationship without hurting him. I don't want to cause him pain, I just don't really feel like this man's daughter and it's always uncomfortable and draining to talk to him. I'm not sure what to do! \n\nTL;DR: I don't view my father as a farher, but don't have a good enough reason to cut ties and I'm not sure what to do. ",

    "body": "My wife (40) and I(40M) have been married for 15 years. We have had our ups and downs. I have always tried to learn from the fights and improve our relationship.\n\nI will just start. It is common in our country to live with family. The inheritance goes to sons in the family so responsibility comes to sons to take care of parents. I still live with my mother. We used to live with my brother and his family but I bought his share out and he has now moved to another place. It was divided into 3 parts; my mom, me and my brother, so I paid 1/3 of supposed worth of the property.\n\nThe house was old and needed to be rebuilt. The house and the land is under my mom's name. When building the house my wife suggested that I keep the property in my name because I would be spending my money to build the house. I talked to my mom and she seemed concerned because there have been a lot of instances where sons got the property in their name and kicked their parents out. It had recently happened to our close neighbor, so my mom was on edge. Honestly, I was a bit hurt but understood her concern. So, I agreed the house and land would still be under my mom's name. My wife said she is not happy and my brother and his family might claim our house after my mom's passing. We fought a bit and I told my wife to find a solution that makes her happy. My wife found a lawyer and made an official document (signed in front of government officials and legally binding ) that stated no matter what I would get the inheritance and my brother will get nothing. My brother and his wife also signed that paper. I thought everything is settled and everyone is happy.\n\nBut my wife was still not happy with this arrangement and she did not feel the house being built was hers. She used to say this all the time. I was alone when the construction began and had to oversee everything myself. We had major fights and I complained that she was not helping me. She made no monetary contribution. She had a business that would only earn enough for grocery. I used to get up everyday at 6 am and go to construction site l, come back at 9 am to home, work full time and check up on construction during lunch and start work again. The reason I had to be there was because workers would run out of things and would just complain about lack of material and stop working. I would personally check if anything would stop the work on that day and buy and arrange things so that work would not be disturbed. \n\nMy wife and I had massive fights, she even ran away for few days without telling anyone. She came back like nothing happened. Then I called her brother and sister and said we need to talk and we need to figure out a solution. \n\nWe talked and she said she would improve and be of more help. Our house was almost built at this point so I accepted and things got better.\n\nShe would still sometimes say the house doesn't feel like hers. I would ignore and I kinda understood because the property was under my mom's name.\n\nAfter 2 years, she got a high paying job( I still make 2.5x more than her, used to be like 10x) . She saved a substantial amount of money enough to put a down payment on the property but not enough to outright buy it. I was happy for her. I helped her buy a new property. She put 40% from her savings, 40% loan and I contributed 20% from my savings. \n\nI worked day and night to find a property she liked. We agreed to buy it. I finally thought she would be happy to have her own property on her name. But she was not. No thank you, no smiling, she was just indifferent at the best and sad and angry at her worst.\n\nI talked to her and said why are you not happy? You have a property under your name. I thought this is what you wanted. Why not a smile and not even a thank you. She just said you have never thanked me for cooking and cleaning why should I thank you for this? It is just not our culture. \n\nShe said she works 14 hours a day. She wakes up at 6, leaves for work at 8 comes back at 6 and when she is done in the kitchen it is around 8, so technically she is right. But I also work, I cook and clean. She cooks during weekdays and I clean and I cook during weekends and she cleans.\n\nThis surprised the fuck out of me and is giving me existential crisis. I felt like I worked so hard to help with small and big things but I have not been able to make her happy. \n\nMy father was abusive asshole so it always was in the back of my mind not to be like him.\n\nI feel like my effort not to be like any other abusive husband doesn't matter. I want to keep my marriage fun and happy. I try and organize multi day international vacations twice a year, she is also not happy during those. She would complain about seeing similar stuffs even in different countries. She nevers plans or suggests a place. She pouts during the whole vacation. We used to go out to eat every Friday evening( so she doesn't need to cook on Fridays) , then she started complaining about food and the places we would go and would get upset. and that also broke down, we no longer do that. \n\nI helped as much as I could.  But when I try to talk to her and say we need to improve as a couple. She just says we have been married for 15 years and this is okay. There is nothing to improve and there will be fights between couples and this is fine.\n\nThis buying new property in her name thing happened two months ago. I kinda was expecting this to be such a milestone and bring new happiness in our life. My wife would have a property in her name. I worked so hard for it. I could not talk to her for two weeks because I was literally  looking for something that she would like every waking minute. After everything was finalized, I told her I was sorry that I was busy with this and let's celebrate by going out. We went out, she did not talk to me. I ordered food, she didn't touch the food. I asked her what's wrong, she didn't speak. I tried to joke but she was cold towards me. I asked her next day, she said she was irritated because of heat ( it was summer in my country). I thought okay. Then when I tried to kiss her she would avoid it, refuse hugs and sex. I got so confused, this was supposed to be a major milestone and make us even closer and happier but this continued for two more weeks.\n\nAfter that something inside me died. I no longer want to do anything anymore for her. I cannot be happy. I just feel like everything I do is useless. She now shows affection but I no longer feel it. I just feel like no matter what I do, she will never be happy. I feel like she is just putting up facade and acting happy now because literally nothing has changed. The new property is still in her name. The old house is still in my mother's name. I can no longer bring myself to laugh or be happy around her. I have been a grumpy guy for 2 months now. I feel terrible and depressed. \n\nTl;dr: I feel like I did all the small and big things for my wife but just cannot make her happy. Now I have turned into a grumpy old guy. What can I change to better this relationship? ",

He and I both have a lot of debt, and his credit cards are entirely maxed out to a 15K limit. Our savings accounts are empty. \n\nI’ve been working on paying off all my debt so I can be financially free. That is my number one goal for the next 6 months, and I know I can pay off all my CC debt (roughly $8K) in that time as long as I stay focused. \n\nI make more money than my boyfriend does, and also he is an undocumented immigrant, so his job opportunities are limited.\n\nWhen I started dating him, I knew he didn’t have a lot of money, but I loved him for who he was.\n\nNow that I’m almost a year into this relationship, I’m starting to realize that my boyfriend and I have very different views on finances. \n\nFor example, my boyfriend is really into music festivals and he has spent thousands of dollars attending them this year. \n\nI have tagged along to a couple of them—because one time, when I told him I couldn’t go to one, he started crying and guilt tripped me into going. (But now he’s pulling the good ol’ “I didn’t force you to go”)\n\nHe could not pay his portion of the rent this month, (we split 50/50) so I had to cover part of it. I didn’t complain about that at first, but now he’s already planning to go to another festival in February instead of saving for our BILLS or paying off his credit cards. He is also going to a smaller event this month (in my opinion, he should sell his ticket).\n\nBut here’s the worst part. Whenever I try to have an adult conversation about this with him, he will either completely shut down or he’ll lash out at me and complain about things like me not helping out around the house or saying that I work too much and I should help him more, or all these other excuses that are irrelevant to the actual problem—which is our financial issues. He’s not open to having a productive conversation about it.\n\nI’m so frustrated that I’m starting to wonder if I should kick him out and pay for our entire apartment myself. I make enough money to do so.\n\nAny advice on how I can navigate this situation? I hate doing things that are too extreme, but I feel like I’m out of options.\n\nTDLR: My boyfriend keeps spending all his money instead of saving for our shared bills, and I want him to change, but I’m getting fed up and I’m thinking about ending it.",

He doesn’t really have a schedule or goals in life, he just heads to work everyday and that’s it. I’m the complete opposite- I had goals since I was a kid and I’m really working towards my professional goals and dreams that require a lot of effort. I’ve been noticing that whenever I’m trying to do something for myself, he gets frustrated. Most of the time that happens when I make plans to see other people. He doesn’t do that, so whenever I’m planning to he then tries to make plans with his friends too, but never on his own schedule and pace. \n\nToday he brought up again that when we were at home together I’m always on my phone. It’s not a new complaint and I really tried to not do that and do more things together while at home, but I’ve noticed that in reality it’s the only time I have some time for myself and I don’t want to give that up. I also feel it’s kinda unfair- today he came home from work at around 9:30 pm, and we decided to stay at home because I was feeling unwell tonight. I told him to go out with his friends but he didn’t want to so he stayed with me. We decided to watch a movie together which lasted 2 hours , and then we were sleepy so we were going to bed. It was a lazy day when he came home, it’s true. But yesterday when he got off from work in the afternoon, we went shopping because he wanted to buy new clothes, we then grabbed a coffee, strolled around the city, and then went to a restaurant. We were out for about 6 hours and I had a really good time. And this happens almost daily, we always go for a walk and most of the times we go out for a drink or dinner. \n\nI really feel stress in this whole situation and it seems unfair to me that he’s always looking for reasons to say I’m not giving him attention. Looking at the bigger picture, I feel like I don’t have enough time for myself and when I do, I feel guilty subconsciously because of his attitude. How can we balance this out? What can I do to understand him more and for him to understand me better? Any advice is appreciated. \n\nTl/dr: I (22F) feel guilty taking personal time away from my bf (27M), and we’re always fighting about similar issues. How to balance it?",

We don't have a lot of fights, but when we do, we just can't communicate with eachother. Every small conflict either turns into a major hours long fight with AWFUL coping mechanisms, or we just agree to move on from it like nothing happened. We are pretty much complete opposites when it comes to our attachment styles and how we communicate. She's avoidant and I'm anxious. I'm very sensitive and emotional, always wanting to talk things out. She compartmentalizes and doesn't like to talk when she's upset. It's basically a recipe for disaster. \n\nToday, after a disagreement, we had a conversation about how we communicate when upset. I told her she could be more sensitive when talking to me so I don't end up feeling like she's upset with me. She told me she would just surpress the emotions and I shouldn't worry about it. I explained to her that  I don't want her to need to surpress her emotions, and that there's a way she can express how she feels without acting annoyed with me, but she wouldn't budge. I know my sensitivity is a large part of the issue, but I've offered many alternative communication strategies to help us get to the point I want to be at. She refuses to adopt any of my ideas and I feel like she antagonizes me whenever I bring up a problem. \n\nToday she told me \"I relent\", after I kept trying to explain to her how we can do something other than compartmentalizing and surpressing. I responded by saying that she doesn't need to relent and that I don't understand why she always sees these conversations as a battle. This struck a chord with her. She told me that no matter what she does, I tell her it's not enough. She said \"I do it my way and I'm wrong, I agree to do it your way and I'm still wrong\".\n\nAfter that I had the feeling that there was a misunderstanding with what I was saying. She wouldn't let me talk after that though, and tried to leave. I chased after her and basically told her \"I didn't mean it like that, I don't want you to relent, I just want you to understand\". She just didn't reply after that, and I have a feeling she is going to give me the silent treatment.\n\nI truly feel like I've communicated my side and my feelings as much as I can, but it just doesn't feel like anything I said or will say has or will ever change anything for us.

The director woman I interviewed with gave me an application to fill out, and once I hand it into her (preferably as soon as possible), she will tell me the next steps in the hiring process (i.e., other paperwork and such, where I will be assigned and with whom, although she implied I would be working with an elementary school student, since I informed her the majority of my students that I tutor are on the younger side).\n\n\n \nMy parents and I were so happy because this is my first full-time job (with benefits!) since graduating college 3.5 years ago in 2021. The pay is \"eh,\"  but not a significant issue since I live at home currently. The problem is, I feel conflicted about leaving my current (and only) part-time job as a tutor at an individually owned center belonging to a national chain of tutoring centers in the US. I love working with the kids, and my co-workers are alright too, but what drives me nuts (as someone on the autism spectrum) is my constantly changing schedule, which is why I am kind of eyeing leaving.\n\n\n \nI also don’t have a car (I have my drivers license, but saving up for a car), and so my parents may have to drive me to and from work for now, and the distance from the town I will be working in and the town my current job is in is about 15-30 minutes away (depending on the traffic), but if I am coming to tutoring directly after school, then it might be that I will end up rushing to work (not sure about my end time, but my day should end between 3-3:30; once everything is finalized, then they will tell me the crucial details), and I don’t want to put the kind of pressure on my parents. And as for public transport, the schools are located within an area (a “boujee” suburb) where public transportation is not the best.\n \n\n\nI feel bad if I left though, because I know there are always kids being enrolled in the center, and they seem to always be on the shorthanded side, even though they just hired several new tutors. My parents think I should just quit for the school year and then ask if I can come back on for the summer, even though it may not work like that (and the school district offers additional work after school and summer program work). I also don’t know if I could leave those kids I’ve established a relationship with after working there for almost 3 years now.\n \nSome guidance and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

This is important info that can hopefully change their lives for the better, but i also understand that at those ages you really dgaf.  I was in middleschool 12 years ago and i know i didnt care. I just want to make it more enjoyable for them (and also for me too. Bc who likes talking to a group of kids who arent listening) \n\nSo yea any ideas or activity recs are welcome. I do have a curriculum i follow but i can somewhat make it my own. I have a couple of online activities but i can't just whip out a kahoot each class. Any advice appreciated and TIA. ",

    "body": "So I am a part time teacher, and I am teaching English, to multiple groups at B1/B2 Levels. While I don't have official teaching certifications I am a native speaker in Spain and I think I am getting the hang of it. I also am tutoring this 13y old girl in English, Sciences, and some Math. This girl seems very bored and uninterested. I have a feeling that she is sick of school and learning and then is forced to come here to learn more. While I dont know her schedule exactly she seems to be in school from 9am to 5 pm, and then goes to my tutoring from 6:30 pm to 8pm.\n\nShe seems to be doing very basic things in English. She is going to an international school and it seems the classes are all in English. Sometimes I feel like I go to fast and she gets frustrated, other times it seems like she is just checked out of the class fiddling with her phone or calculator.\n\n  \nI do know she likes games, cause apparently her teacher makes them play on a website called https://wordwall.net/.  They seem very basic to me, stuff like crossword puzzles and matching tile games. I don't know if her level is that low or if she is just wasting my time.\n\n  \nI want to engage with her, so I asked her what songs and artists she likes. She mentioned Rihanna and Adele, so I wonder if there is a way I can do some listening exercises with songs to make her more engaged in learning, but I feel that some songs will either be too advanced or have rather poor English grammar.\n\nWhat should I do?",

    "title": "30 Minute Lessons No Materials Middle (ESL) Need a brain storm!",
    "body": "Hey everybody, I work in Korea teaching ESL at an afternoon cram school. I've been teaching for 7 years and didn't expect this new position to catch me off guard, but it did!\n\nThis job has four 30 minute classes with middle schoolers (different grades but all intermediate level English), two of which are Mon/Wed/Fri, and the other two are Tues/Thurs. There are zero materials for these classes other than the whiteboard I have. There is no powerpoint, no books, and this job doesn't have an available computer/printer. \n\nI thought I could figure this out, but I'm at one month with this position now and I am really struggling. What I want to do is create a universal class structure, so the Mon/Tues would be the same lesson, and Wed/Thurs would be a different lesson. Friday I'm not worried about at the moment.\n\nSo far for the month I've tried a lot of different things, mostly different variations of standard ESL games that work with a whiteboard, and they were received well. The biggest success I've had is when I ran a random topic/memorization lesson. I wrote out 8 topics, students choose a number 1-8, and whichever number is the topic they have to talk about for however long they can. The other students who aren't speaking have to memorize their answer. \n\nSo that worked best and had the most meaning in terms of practicing English, and that will be my Mon/Tues class. A bit of extra work for me, but I'll spend the weekend writing out a 100 topics or so and then that'll be it for a couple months at least.\n\nThe real problem I'm having is that, for some reason, I am completely blanking on creating a simple and stable lesson for the Wed/Thurs. I cannot think of what to do for some reason--- even reflecting on the month, while those ESL game/activities worked well and the kids were very responsive to them, they aren't really something that I can make an everyday lesson out of. For example, the students really responded to activities like \"Stop the Bus\" and category word lists (write out A-Z, and have the students come up with a word for each letter based on category). Fun and fast lessons, and while I have total freedom with the classroom and could just do that every Wed/Thurs I really don't want to--- it's just a bit too low in terms of the content for it to feel meaningful for me.\n\nSo I was just wondering if anyone has ever been in a similar situation, has any ideas? Maybe a variation on debate that I'm somehow missing that's simple and fun? I know the prior teacher basically ran on a single lesson for all classes, which seems to be that he wrote a sentence on the board and then had the students come up with a story, them speaking and he writing it out. That's fine, but it's not really my style--- I'd really rather have the students centered on something, like with the topic lesson I'll be doing Mon/Tues, because then it's student-led and I can also step back and let the students engage each other with different opinions and small fun arguments. \n\nSo any ideas: A 30 minute lesson with no materials, middle schoolers, ESL, intermediate/high intermediate level. Even if you don't work in ESL I'd really to hear whatever ideas or experiences you've had with classes that solely depended on you as instructor rather than any materials. Really hoping I can solve this soon because it's wild walking into a classroom and not knowing what do at all, as happened yesterday. Totally blanked, and wow--- felt horrible. So! Eager to hear any ideas, willing to try just about anything. \n\nThanks!\n\n ",

    "body": "I am a long-term sub for a 7th grade English class. I was a student teacher at this school last year and I’ve been subbing for this class since the first day of school (we are 7 weeks in). I have a student in one of my classes who has disruptive behaviors. I have spoken with his guardian and gotten more info about his background &amp; I have been trying different strategies to minimize his disruptions and keep him on-task. It’s very difficult. Yesterday I emailed the counselor asking for any ideas, to which she gave none. Today in class, I turned to look toward this student and saw he was holding 2-3 medium-sized razor blades in the palm of his hand. I quietly told him to go outside &amp; followed behind. I took the blades from him into a tissue. We stood outside the classroom because I had no one to watch my class. He was incredibly nonchalant, which is his general demeanor. He told me a different student gave them to him (said student was at that time in the health office). I asked an aide passing by to call a proctor to come escort the student to the office. They said the office wasn’t answering. They kept calling. As a sub, I’m not 100% sure of protocols, so I asked another aide from a different class who was passing by to also call. Several minutes passed. I saw the maintenance lead about 50 feet away and yelled for him to radio a proctor. No teachers have radios, but the proctors do. He radio’d and finally, after at least 10 minutes of standing outside with this kid, the VP and all of the proctors came over. The VP first asked what was going on. I told her this student had a few razor blades. Her next question was “how did this come up?” I thought that was weird. I said “I looked over and he was holding them?” She took him away as well as the other student who was walking back from the nurse. After school ended, the student came BACK to my class to ask an unrelated question. I was so surprised to see him. He said he did not get into any trouble and was just told to be careful when taking stuff from people. I talked to the VP &amp; counselor after school and they didn’t suspend either student and said “they did all they could.” They clearly didn’t want to talk about it and I didn’t push because I didn’t have my bearings yet— due to shock at the situation and probably because I’m not experienced and also shy. I was just wondering— is this normal? I felt like this was kind of a big deal… not being able to contact anyone for help in a serious situation as well as no consequences being given to the students seems insane to me. I know I didn’t handle this in the best way, but I was doing the best I could in the moment. ",

I have noticed a trend that has popped up not only in schools but also in parenting tips/advice videos.\n\nLiterally about fifteen minutes ago I saw a teacher with her arm underneath the shoulder of a 3rd or 4th grade boy, and she was walking him somewhere he clearly didn't want to go. The boy was walking, but reluctantly. The teacher said, \"Are you ready to walk? No? Okay, I'll keep helping.\" Meaning she was going to keep her arm under his as they walked together. The boy wasn't limping, he was resisting.\n\nI've also heard a parenting hack where it's like, if your kid is refusing to do something, you're supposed to say \"you have two choices--you can put your pajamas on by yourself, or, I will put my hands over your hands and help you put your pajamas on.\"\n\nThis use of the word \"help\" makes my skin CRAWL. This is not what \"help\" means. If you consistently use the word this way, kids will grow up with negative associations about \"help.\" I think it's a sick way of reframing it so that the adult doesn't feel like they're forcing the child to do something, but I doubt the child feels like they are receiving assistance of any kind.

I have a few videos that made me understand it the most. And i've tried taking one idea i have and slowly write out an outline along with watching the video that breaks down the story structure. But not only have i ended up with countless ideas, it's not even in the same genre. So i have many scattered ideas saved up.\n\nSo i tried a different approach, work on characters for a bit, and then maybe i can organically come up with a plot. Same problem.\n\nI would come up with a character, their struggles but there are COUNTLESS plots that the struggles and internal conflict can escalate. And again, it's not even limited to a single genre either.\n\nAnd then i tried combining a relationship, an arc and a story. Like a father and son dynamic, how their relationship changes throughout the story and the type of plot. But i have countless of ideas of not only what kind of arc they will have, but the different plot and again, so many genres \n\nAnd it's not only that, i heavily struggle trying to figure out from whose pov my story could be in.\n\nFor example, i come up with a character, a struggle, their relationships. I have the character arc down. And again, i'm trying to come up with a plot.\n\nBut not only do i come up with different plots, but it also includes the character i'm focused on either being a main character, just a side character. A part of a multipov book, or  dual pov. Or involved in a single pov. \n\nI've tried many types of character worksheets, videos about how to develop characters, again, trying to focus on one idea. \n\nAnd i keep getting mentally bombarded with random scene ideas as well. And not only that, but i think of countless ways the same scene could go. And not only that, but i would think of existing scenes i have thought of and how they could connect. But again, there are ENDLESS possibilites, not just two or three.\n\nFor example, one of the million scene ideas is a father and son reunite the hospital.\n\nIt's not just the dialogue that changes, or how the character reacts that changes, but i can't tell if that scene belongs in a supernatural book, in an action book, in a slasher book, a horror book. And i again can't pick what lead to them reuniting at the hospital in the first place. And there are times where i don't even know if they should reunite at the hospital, or at an ambulance. Or at someone's house (i can't even decide on a single setting lol)\n\nAnd the backstories of the characters and the relationships keeps changing as well\n\nI tried making a list of my ideas when it came to a particular subject. Like what is the backstory of the father and son who goes through a story arc change while going through tough times.\n\n\n\nBut i literally can't pick which one i like more. Heck, i can't even choose if the father and son should be biologically related, or if they are step father and step son. Or if it's just a middle aged guy developing a fatherly bond with a young guy.\n\n\n\nSorry if this comes across as jumbled, i tried my best to edit this, a few times. Just ask specific questions, and i'll clarify what i mean\n\n\n\nFrom the outside looking in, do you have any advice? ",

I’ve always been fascinated by novels/stories that place children in serious situations and in a more mature or adult context (think Stephen King works like IT or The Body, or Golding’s Lord of the Flies), so that’s the kind of thing I’ve been going for in my story. A group of young kids in a more serious situation that teeters on horror and blurs the lines of morality. It’s also historical fiction, and I don’t mean the 80s — which are quite a popular decade — but the 1920s and 1930s.

I do write for myself too and enjoy my work, so I wouldn’t be put off writing it per say but I wonder if there’s even a chance of getting traditionally published if you don’t have a story that is trendy enough to probably sell well.)\n",

He suggested that I tackle it in a more humorous way or have some comic relief. I don't know how I feel about this but what I do know is that this book is talking about the worst phases of chronic depression, the main character is doing her unfinished business before committing suicide at the end of the book (not a spoiler) and the novel follows her as she does those things and her messy thoughts, her messy past, her relationships with those around her, her mental illness at its core and I feel like comedy has no place in the middle except maybe a scene or two and it will be forced. \nWhat do you guys think?",

I’m planning to use both of these in my story, but for a good reason. \n\nFirst of all the whole setting of this story is northern Germany and Denmark around the year 200 a.d. and the biggest Germanic settlements rarely had over 200 or 300 people (and I’m planning to make the book as historical accurate as it is possible for a fantasy story). So starting anywhere but in a village is literally not possible. \nAlso I never really called my mc a farmboy, tho there is a scene where he is cleaning the stables of his cows and goats. \n\nAlso I’m planning on making it a dilogy (two-book series) and during the end of my first book I’m planning to kill a character, who will be resurrected during the last chapters of the second book. While I know this is an absolutely hated trope (I hate it myself) I think I have good reasons for doing so. \n\nThe second book is basically about the mc stopping a fanatic follower of the gods (his former mentor) who goes on a rampage and tries to kill all the souls in Helheim (Germanic hell) in order to stop the goddess Hel to be able to ever use these souls during Ragnarök to attack Asgard; and also it’s about the mc rescuing his best friend (and potentially lover/bromance(?)) who got kidnapped by said fanatic follower at the very end of the first book (there is also a very good reason for that, but I can’t elaborate everything in this post. But basically he serves as a slave creating special weapons for the antagonist). \n\nNow there is ofc a lot more of story and plot which I can not put in one single post, but basically after stopping his former mentor and the potential war he nearly started, the mc is in Helheim, seeing all the people he lost during his lifetime (parents, friends, and so on) and is granted by Hel herself to bring one person back with him (that is something that was very much possible in the Germanic mythology, as long as Hel is allowing it). And in the end his parents say he shall return the friend he lost during the end of the first book, since she was very young when she died. \nBasically this choice is supposed to mark a point where he starts looking at the present and values current relationships over lost ones if that makes any sense.\n\nIs it ok to use these tropes or do they sound cheap and uncreative to you?\n\n(Also sorry for any grammar mistakes.

It's hard to do that with prose because I'm not sure how to perfect the balance of 'in-your-face' and 'what are you even on about'. \n\nIs it lazy to rely on dialogue to tell your story (if writing a book)?

    "body": "I’ve seen people on this sub suggest that adult books (as in books aimed at a grown-up audience, older than YA) require lots of sex and/or violence to be successful, but I’ve always felt this was a fallacy. When you’re a kid, growing up, you will be drawn to things that seem more mature and want to leave things that feel ‘childish’ behind. This is why graphic fighting games like Mortal Kombat were so big in the 90s, why kids today love horror games like FNAF, and why teenage girls swoon over spicy romance.  Yet I don’t think anyone would describe those things as ‘mature’, even by adults who enjoy them (and I’m not saying adults can’t enjoy them; many prefer the simplicity and light themes, myself included). They give the appearance of maturity while being simple enough thematically to appeal to younger audiences. \n\nIn fact, many of these things will be more overt to compensate. I’ve read plenty of books written for an adult audience that have little-to-no sex or violence, but I would never make the argument they were for kids because of their complex plots, subtle or dark themes, or content that would seem dull to teenage adrenaline junkies. I feel a book for adults meets its readers on their level, and doesn’t try to patronise or censor, but aim to be nuanced and not rely on fanservice for appeal.\n\nWhat do you think?",

And now I have to figure out how to show this to the readers.\n\nI've also have people talking about character choice in text messages, and notes about tone that I'm going to have to resolve in a future draft. Or leave as is, as that could be the POV character understanding the tone being used.\n\nAnd talking about text messages, I have sometimes massive differences in word choices for characters in their texts versus their actual speach.\n\nBecause of the character based language they are supposedly writing in, you just can't easily say some things, and others are damn near impossible without the use of a third (and restricted-use) written language! \n\nAnd, yeah, I was sarcastic in my first use of the term, but figuring out all of these workarounds actually is FUN, albeit not necessarily in the moment I present myself with the problem.\n\nIt does delay my writing for a bit, sure, but all that really means is I'm building a specialty tool for this story, and when I'm done I can pull it out as needed in the future.

In fact, not sure if this'll be deleted but we'll see lol   \n  \nSkip to the end for TLDR if you want, cuz I wrote more than needed  \n  \nI finally decided to sit down and try to write a original novel as it’s one of my lifelong goals. Atm, I mostly write silly character interactions and OC x Canon (not necessarily ships), one shots, etc… So it’s my first kinda major project.\n\nThings are going pretty smooth, as I found one of my old story concepts which easily revived my memories of those characters and their world (it's a kinda atypical plot of a MC actually part of this world they never realized I existed. And I love it.), and I quickly got to work fleshing out the characters and identities which was pretty easy and fun for me, and planning the arcs, coming up with plot elements and world building tidbits was especially fun!\n\nHowever, it didn't take me long to realize I needed to  plan out the story. I’ve seen enough writing videos and advice to know that writing longform content like this is VERY different to one shots.\n\nI'm pretty sure this question has been asked dozen times before, so I googled some options first, and tried out a couple of methods, like the 3 Act Story Structure, Hero's Journey, the Five Act structure...  \n  \nAnd on paper, it was rlly good advice! I see the point and I know why certain things are needed. But when I started to actually fill those out…it practically killed my motivation. So I dragged myself to finish that. But I couldn’t be able to put pen to paper to write anything at all. Like it feels like I have to drag myself through it, even though I already got a direction to start.  \n  \nAfter multiple attempts, I came to the conclusion that the lack of allowing myself to be creative and trying to stick to a structure was the issue. But I know it wasn't going to fly to try to write the story with no plan at all.\n\nMaybe an make an argument that writing should be constantly worked on and not run purely on motivation, which I do agree with. I have fallen into those pitfalls before. But it just feels like I'm stuck before I even properly started.\n\nI don't know. Is this a me-trying-to-run-on-motivation problem and I should just work through it? Is there a way to possibly plan without...planning it at the same time?\n\n\n\nTLDR; Writing story structures drain me before I could even start writing the story. Not sure if it's a motivation problem or not. Asking advice on how to plan out the story with that in mind.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for all your comments and advice :D\nI'm not good at replying to comments, so I'll just say you guys all explained it pretty clearly and the approach I should go for. I will try those ASAP and will update on progress probably!!!\n\n Thanks again for taking the time to reply to silly long article of a reddit post. Genuinely appreciate it ^^",

I'm sure this has been posted by others before many times, but I'll share my take. It's been an uncomfortable revelation, but something I've known for a while now. \n\nFor the last decade I've been pushing myself to write and complete something: a story, be it short story, a novel, etcetera. It's not that I've lacked ideas or premises per se, but after compiling some notes I've never had the desire to follow through. And I have a lot of notes. Everytime I've started, I would soon hit a wall. I haven't been able to get invested, and yet whenever I read or watch a good story, I'm confronted by what could only be defined as a sense of guilt for not putting my creativity and understanding to use. \n\nThe last time I was really invested was about a decade ago, like I mentioned before. What was different is that I was fully invested in the characters, the setting, the world. I understood what my objective was, i.e. what I was trying to say. The meaning, not just what happens (plot). It's the furthest I've ever made it in completing a story, and to this day it remains as is. Every attempt since hasn't gotten past the conceptual stage. \n\nSo what changed exactly? Simple: I did. I am struggling to reconnect with that old self, with those old stories of youth. And there's a sense of loss and grief associated with that. Back then writing was fun. It was a form of entertainment. It was about self expression. Expectations were minimal. The topics that come to me are disconnected from my old approach. And they're not entertaining per se. I suppose I've grown up in a way and yet I understand that this has affected my desire my write. \n\nI understand that this reads as more of a journal entry than a literal question. I suppose what I'm asking is have any of you managed to reconnect with your old selves and passion, or is there merit in leaving the past in the past and accepting one's current perspective and understanding while still finding some passion in the process?

It's 8am on a Sunday and I live alone which means it HAS to be an emergency. Because I sleep nude, I take the time to put on underwear and my pants before running toward the door. Two 50-60ish women with wide smiles, the happy chirps of morning people and the light of angles in their eyes suddenly ask me:   \n\"Hello my Son, do you know God?\"  \nI pause, dumbstrucked, before replying angrily:  \n\"Yeah. You wanna see him?\"  \nBefore undoing the cord of my pants and showing them my underwear. They back off, scoff and flee toward the next flapt.  \n\"HAVE A NICE DAY LADIES!\"  \nAnd I slammed the door hard enough to wake the whole building. First time they ever visited, the last time they did. Don't wake a sleeping atheist. Ever.\n\n\n\n-Second time: I'm in the bus, reading Dan Simmon's Hyperion (classic 80's SF novel) and minding my own business. The bus stops, a 20 something woman enters and sits on the seat next to me. The bus starts rolling again then she asks what I'm reading. I show her the book and its title without talking, not interested in a conversation. But she pulls out a pamphlet and gives it to me while saying \"Well if you like reading maybe this could interest you.\" I stop reading, grab it, realise it's from Watchtower, pause for dramatic effect (and searching for a premade punchline I had read a few nights prior) before giving it back politely to her with a simple \"No thanks, I don't need an imaginary sky daddy to deal with my mortality.\" before going back to my book to ignore her royally. She exited at the next stop.\n\n\n\n- Third time: I'm at my Grand Parents' for a family meal and melt into their swimming pool. The intercom buzzes and they groan. I ask them what's wrong. They tell me it must be the Jehovah's Witnesses and that they have been coming almost everyday for the last three weeks. I tell them I'll deal with it.  \nI answer the intercom.  \n\"Yeah?\"  \n \"We would like to talk to you about God. Can we come in?\"  \n\"Great timing you guys, We were about to sacrifice a goat for the glory of Satan, wanna join?\"  \n\"...\"  \n\"... you still there?\"  \nCut to six months later, at my grand parents for a november meal and the intercom buzzes, just the mailman this time. When my grandad comes back he comments that the Jehovah's Witness never came back. I tell them why and they have a good laugh, saying they'll use it should they ever come back.\n\n  \nWhat other snappy comments or tricks have you used against these public nuisances?",

Even writing this is making me irritable.\n\nMy boyfriend of two years is very Christian and religion is a sore spot between us. I know that he wishes I shared his faith or conviction, but I don't. I doubt I ever will. We've fought about it before. Sometimes I wonder if he'd love me more if I *did* echo his beliefs. I've tried time and time again for his sake, but it's all empty. \n\nI was sexually, emotionally and physically abused for almost all of my life. Every man who assaulted me claimed to be a man of God. A devout Catholic, a Pastor's son, a man who had just finished seminary school. I've already accepted that I will likely never truly heal from it, and to dull the disgust I feel when thinking about it, I just tell myself it wasn't that bad. That helps to a degree.\n\nBut every time I try to find solace in God, it resurfaces, and I hate myself for experiencing it, I hate my abusers for doing it, and I hate God for allowing it. I feel so much rage that all I can do is cry. \n\nThe men that did this to me will never really face justice for what they did, and that's fine. It seems the world rewards evil anyway.\n\nBut when does this pain end? Therapy, acceptance, prayer, forgiveness, charity - not a single thing has worked to heal this anger and evilness in me. I rarely feel joyful, or excited, or content. I spend my days stewing over what I've lived through, barely getting by, almost never sleeping. I never have a moment of peace.\n\nI come back looking for answers to what's wrong with me and am told the same thing over and over: accept it, let yourself be hurt, work through it. How do I work through this? Am I what happened to me, or was it all meaningless? Is the answer four different medications and a psychiatrist or a God that the mere notion of causes me pain?\n\nI have come to God completely broken, at both ten and twenty years old, begging for healing or even a moment of respite.\n\nI have nothing.

    "body": "\nhello, i’m a christian my mom and i converted when i was around 8 or 9 years old, before that we were hindu. where i’m from (nepal), christians aren’t really accepted and they’re mainly discriminated i guess but it’s not like there isn’t a lot of them, it’s just majority of them are hindu. they call christianity a “foreigners religion” (bideshi dharma in nepali)\n\nwhen i first converted, i didn’t really know what i was doing. i was just going to church, making friends and going to sunday school. as i grew older, i wouldn’t say that i was really close to God until this year. i’m christian, i pray and i have been going to church every sunday ever since i was 9 but i’ve done a lot of bad sinful things which i regret so much, ever since i got closer to God i’ve repented about it but i don’t think i really felt like i was at peace?\n\nearlier this year, me &amp; my boyfriend started dating. he’s muslim and i’d say he’s like religious but also not SO religious? (as he says) we’ve talked about marriage and stuff because we both thought that it’s better to talk about all that now than to talk about it later and have it be a problem since we’re in an interfaith relationship and obviously there’s gonna be problems. we’ve talked about stuff like marriage, kids, etc. he never pressured or forced me to convert to islam and i would never convert just for him, i’m really grateful he doesn’t force me to because i know many people that kind of force their significant others to convert to their religion, i also know how some people convert for their s/o and i think that’s so wrong because i think that people should convert by their own faith. \n\nlately, i’ve been thinking of converting to islam. it all started when i was going through some problems and came across a playlist containing nasheeds, i was hesitant about listening to them because i wasn’t sure if i could like if it was right or wrong but eventually i listened and i felt so comforted, i felt so at peace. from then on i’ve been kind of reading about islam here and there and i told my boyfriend about it as well and he was obviously really happy about that. \n\ni also have this one friend who recently just converted and she’s changed so much as a person, she’s turned away from her old ways and i’m genuinely so happy for her and her achievements so far. \n\nthe thing with islam is that i like how it’s one God and that’s that, it’s not like God then holy spirit and son of God (the holy trinity). and i also feel like i don’t really know much about christianity like if someone were to ask me to talk about christianity to them i genuinely would not know what to say (it’s happened before😭) because i don’t really understand it? i guess. but in islam i feel like it’s not complicated like that at all. also i feel like it’s not really forced because at church, there’s some things we have to do like dancing for certain events or other things and they force us to because “it’s for God” like we don’t have an option to say no because that’s what they say and we feel guilty about that. i just feel like some of the things i do are forced.\n\nbut i’ve seen the stuff that God has done in not only my life but also my moms life so sometimes i feel guilty about wanting to convert but at the same time i wanna learn more about it without converting first and i’ve told my boyfriend about that and he sends me reels about islam here and there and if i have any questions, he answers them.\n\ni think for now i just wanna learn about islam but i’m not really sure what to do either because i’m kinda stuck the decision of what i wanna do but my boyfriend he comforts me and tells me to put it in God’s hands. \n\nif i do decide to convert, i have no idea what my mom’s reaction would be but i feel like my church would influence her about stuff especially now that i’m with a muslim guy because i know that people at church have done similar stuff like this, for example my church told this one sister to not marry this one guy even tho he was a pastor and another sister to not go to uk to study so that she can stay and do God’s work at our church. but at the same time, i know that our family isn’t really ENTIRELY supportive about us being christian and maybe she’d understand that because we’ve went thru this kinda when we became christian so i’m kinda hoping she’ll understand.\n\ni’m not really sure what to do and i’m open to hear you guys’ advice and opinions, thank you sm",

    "title": "How does anyone know what’s correct?",
    "body": "TL;DR -- it seems that there is someone from every major religious background/spiritual belief system that seems to back their beliefs based on their \"personal relationship with God,\" but obviously not everyone can be right because so many belief systems manage to be so abstract from one another. Despite my tireless search for answers in my life, I do believe that there is a God, but my understanding of what version of God IS *GOD* leaves ms feeling lost and confused. I feel like I'm failing as a person by not just drowning myself in belief/faith, but certain aspects of every religion leaves me feeling like there's some form of false idolatry involved... which is literally breaking Commandment #1. Then again, it is also a major sin to deny God... and I'm not trying to do that either of course. But who am I to say that one person is lying over another? Knowing multiple people of multiple backgrounds who would DIE right now just to prove that they are committed to God as they see Him? Why is it all so vague and complicated? I understand the concept of having faith, but the best metaphor I can offer is feeling like I'm being thrown into a room with 25 people and being told that 24 of them are murderers but 1 will save me from a gruesome death -- and all I have to do is read all of their books and come to a conclusion of who is \"the good guy.\" \n\nThe Bible speaks at length about Satan being deceptive as well, which confuses me in and of itself because if *I* were Satan, I'd take full advantage of changing the book left behind thousands of years ago in order to either scare people away from God or make things as confusing as possible for those who want to lead honest lives and have a blessed eternal life after this one is over. Or, I'd flood the world with so much information and deceive so many people into believing that they have a direct connection with God, that nobody could ever narrow down what the truth was. It all leaves me feeling very scared, lost, alone and confused. I just want to be doing the right thing at the end of the day, but feel like it's nearly impossible.\n\nLONGER VERSION:\n\nContext: I consistently find myself seeking answers in The Bible, due to my upbringing and environment. As a teenager, I more or less flipped to agosticism/atheism over the years. As I've gotten older, however, I find myself leaning back on religion. I don't think it's proper to call myself a \"Christian,\" but that's what I grew up with and what feels familiar.\n\nQuestion: No matter how many times I attempt to seek answers from The Bible, or gain knowledge/spiritual comfort, I find myself at a loss. There's so many religions in this world, beliefs, unique human experiences, etc. all the while we also experience things so similarly (I often think of the \"meme\" of sorts where people feel like something applies to them only and then everyone says \"Wait, this thing hasn't only happened to JUST me?! Have I EVER had a unique experience?!\")\n\nThat being said, within all of those religions and beliefs, so many people seem steadfast in their ways and claim that they have personally heard from God Himself or been shown \"the way.\" But... who is right? Who is wrong? Is anyone right? Is anyone wrong?\n\nI find myself in a mental spiral at times due to this. \n\nThe Bible explicitly states that there is ONE God. And then there's Jesus, who is also God... but He's not separate from God or 1/3 God... He's 100% God, but so is God, and so is The Holy Spirit. So that's still one God... and then there's people from every background stating that the Christian God is not God, but XYZ religion's God is God. They back this with their spiritual teachings or personal experience in life.\n\nTo some, Jesus was a good man but also not God. But, if I don't accept Jesus, then I'm inherently denying God. I don't want to deny God, but I've never had some defining moment despite years of searching and studying for answers where I thought anything sounded correct.\n\nUltimately, I do believe in *A* God. But I also believe that anything that God may have wanted us to know now, was likely heavily tainted, edited or mistranslated over history. Even in modern dialect, there's a significant amount of mistranslation that takes place. How would script from thousands of years ago, accurately be translated as originally intended to modern English? There's so many translations of The Bible, to the extent that they can say VERY different things -- as if they're not even the same book. Beyond this, passing through so many hands over time and having so many \"authors,\" how am I supposed to discern if some evil person along the way wanted to deceive people and present God or God's teachings as different? \n\nEvery time I ask these questions to people more educated than myself, I often receive an answer along the lines of:\n\n\"Have faith! If He just showed Himself to us, there'd be no reason to have faith!\" I'm familiar with the concept of faith, but EVERY religion says to have faith... I have faith that God is, but I feel like on one hand I'm worshipping a false idol in Jesus while on the other I'm potentially denying God by not ACCEPTING Jesus IS God. \n\n\"The Bible is the Word of God, you just have to read it/absorb it/believe it.\" There's so much conflicting information, and things that one person takes in a different way than another person. This is scary to me. Humans are notoriously awful at relaying information, even in the modern age where documentation/translation/transcription is easier than ever in human history. Nobody tampered with the texts of a 2,000 year old book? NOBODY?\n\n\"God has spoken to me directly/loudly/undeniabily and I KNOW His truths to be THE truth!\" I have connected with a relatively diverse set of people in my life. I have absolutely heard this statement about EVERY popular/major religious view at least once. I don't believe a majority of these people to be liars, but I feel that they're taking their own inner monologues as God speaking to them. And, with that knowledge, do I deny a schizophrenic man to be speaking the truth of a spiritual experience he had because he's labeled mentally ill? Or, could schizophrenia be of some spiritual origin that some are tapped in to? Looking at stuff like the story of Moses, if some guy ran around saying God spoke to him through a burning bush in the modern age, that guy would get thrown into a psychiatric hospital or disregarded as a drug abuser/liar spewing nonsense. Just because I'm not directly experiencing someone \"feeling/hearing God's presence in their life,\" within their belief system, doesn't give me the right to say they're lying or not. Nor does hearing some man in the street say that he's being tormented by demons or being sent by God for XYZ Purpose give me the right to call him mentally ill... then again, I don't want to enable someone's sickness and suggest that they should just pray away their woes to grow closer to God rather than seek treatment for an illness.\n\nEveryone seems to claim to be right, but obviously not everyone can be right. I yearn for learning the truth. My prayers always start with the fact that I want to believe what God wants me to believe, and not what man wants me to believe. I want to receive the freedom, healing, love and eternal happiness allegedly offered by God to those who \"know Him\" and praise Him. But ultimately, I do not know Him. I can not see Him, hear Him, etc. and I feel that forcing myself to have faith isn't having faith at all. I also feel like I am in some way denying God or leaving a door open to false idolatry by praying to be steered in the proper direction. If I have the thought pop up in my mind to go read The Book of Mormon, is that my own human curiosity trying to fill in a blank, Satan trying to \"steer me away\" or is that God speaking to where to find answers? Where's the difference? \n\nI feel that I find myself steered away from all religion while yearning from God. It feels like there is a certain amount of evil in all of it, which I do not understand. A bad gut feeling. But does that bad gut feeling make ME evil, for being repulsed in a way by all of these various scriptures? Obviously modern technology allows for quick fact checking, but if I were to leave a deceptive set of texts laying around 1,000 years ago claiming that I was the first human that could float in thin air and someone got ahold of it after I was dead, and it was handed down for generations ... there's nobody to prove such things right or wrong. The later generations might have a massive divide over whether I was an insane, compulsive liar or if I was a magical being sent by The Divine that had special privilege to show His Glory.\n\nI just feel lost, frustrated, scared, alone and confused. I've prayed until I had no more words left to pray, and left the door open for God to place what needed to be prayed upon my heart if I didn't already know it. Nothing. I've sought the prayers written in The Bible. Also nothing. I don't necessarily feel that everyone with spiritual experience/understanding is a liar (though I do feel that many are deceptive for personal gain at times,) but when I myself do not have this experience or concept to hold on to, it makes me wonder if I'm among the souls that will be eternally separated from God. I want to do the right thing, there's a desire to do good within my heart, but I find myself in a repetitive thought-loop where I think that I understand something followed by a complete non-understanding and confusion. But, there's no magical force or specific words in any set of religious text that seems to make me go \"AHA! This is the ONE!\"\n\nDoes anyone have any insight or wisdom to offer? Were you once me, and then you found your way/understanding later on in life? Did my prior non-belief as a budding child into adulthood leave my soul eternally excluded, despite the fact I was just angry/confused? I'm still angry and confused, but nothing makes ANY sense if someone didn't start all of this. I think the world is ultimately a beautiful creation. There's just so much ugliness, hatred and division that it makes me want to crawl out of my skin attempting to figure out what is genuinely \"The Truth.\"",

    "title": "Cautionary tale of a 1st century Jew",
    "body": "Once upon a time, around 50 AD, there lived John the Pharisee. John was a great and devout Jew. He studied the words of the prophets and followed them closely, confident that God had spoken through them once and for all. He was well-versed in the Law of Moses, and like his fellow Pharisees, he believed in resurrection and angels, but always with the scriptures as his guide.\n\nThen one day, he started hearing about one of his former peers, Saul—now calling himself Paul—preaching some very strange things. Paul claimed to have seen a vision of a man named Jesus Christ, but there were conflicting accounts of what really happened. Sometimes it was said he saw Jesus on the road, sometimes that it was a bright light. It seemed like Paul himself couldn’t keep the details straight.\n\nPaul was claiming that Jesus, this carpenter from Nazareth, was not only the Messiah but that he had risen from the dead and was even divine! John had heard of this Jesus before, but he knew one thing for certain: He couldn’t be a true prophet of God. Jesus had added to the Law! Deuteronomy was very clear—not a single word should be added to or taken from the Law. Yet here was Jesus, doing things like healing on the Sabbath and forgiving sins as if he had the authority of God himself. Even worse, Paul was reinterpreting the scriptures to fit his narrative. John thought it was absurd—how could this Jesus be the Messiah when he clearly failed to fulfill the prophecies?\n\nFor instance, the Hebrew scriptures said that the Messiah would rule as a king and restore Israel to its glory, defeating all its enemies. But Jesus? He was crucified by the Romans! How could the true Messiah die like a criminal? Some of these new Christians were trying to twist the scriptures to explain away his death, claiming the Messiah’s role was spiritual, not political. But John knew better—centuries of rabbinic tradition couldn’t be wrong.\n\nAnd the so-called “miracles” of Jesus? Just tricks, no doubt. Maybe some were fooled by them, but John was certain they were mere sleight of hand. He had even heard one story about Jesus healing a man with mud and spit. That hardly seemed like the work of a prophet! Plus, Jesus had clearly failed as a prophet. Didn’t he say that the end would come before that generation passed away? Well, here we are, and the world is still turning. According to the Law, that made him a false prophet.\n\nAnother thing John couldn’t understand was this claim that Jesus was somehow divine. The scriptures explicitly state that no one can see God and live. How could this Jesus, who walked and talked among people, be God? It was a clear contradiction. The Pharisees had been interpreting these scriptures for hundreds of years, and this new group wanted to tell them they were wrong?\n\nJohn had also started hearing rumors that Jesus had ulterior motives. Some said that Jesus was only out for personal gain—perhaps fame, influence, or even power. Why else would he gather so many followers around him? John suspected that Jesus was trying to build a movement for his own benefit. Maybe he wanted to be seen as a great leader or a prophet so that people would admire him, serve him, and give him glory. Some claimed that Jesus had amassed a group of followers just to elevate himself, and look where that led—betrayed, arrested, and executed. A failed messiah if there ever was one.\n\nThen there was the story that Jesus had risen from the dead. John found it laughable. If Jesus had truly risen, why was there so little proof? Only a handful of people claimed to have seen him alive again, and the story kept changing. Some said an angel moved the stone; others claimed they saw him on the road. And where was Jesus now? If he was really alive, shouldn’t he be out preaching? John suspected that someone had simply stolen the body.\n\nEven worse, one of the men closest to Jesus, Judas, had fallen away. Judas had been one of his inner circle, but in the end, he betrayed Jesus to the authorities. If Judas, one of Jesus' chosen followers, could fall away, what did that say about Jesus’ movement? Clearly, it wasn’t divinely inspired if one of the twelve had turned against him. John thought it was obvious—if those closest to Jesus didn’t stick around, why should anyone believe in this so-called resurrection?\n\nJohn was also puzzled by the contradictions within this new movement. Peter, one of Jesus’ closest followers, said that only Jews should be welcomed into the movement. But now Paul, a former Pharisee like John, was preaching to Gentiles and saying they could be saved without even following the Law of Moses! They couldn’t even agree on what their beliefs were, so how could they claim to have the truth?\n\nWhat really troubled John, though, was that some of these Christians were treating Paul’s letters as scripture. This was outrageous! Scripture had been sealed with the prophet Malachi—God hadn’t spoken through prophets for hundreds of years, and everyone knew that. Yet here were these Christians claiming God was speaking again. They were even calling Paul’s letters scripture, as if they could be on the same level as the Torah or the Prophets! John thought it was laughable. How could they think there was any need for new scripture when they already had everything they needed in the Law and the Prophets?\n\nTo make matters worse, there were some people—like the Bereans—who were actually going along with Paul’s teachings! John had heard they were studying the scriptures, but instead of seeing that Paul was twisting them, they were somehow accepting his words! It was baffling. John was convinced they weren’t using the scriptures properly. If they were truly following scripture, they would reject Paul outright, because the scriptures clearly say God’s word is complete. We already have the Law and the Prophets, so why would God need to say more?\n\nJohn also heard that some of Jesus' teachings were kept secret, shared only with a select few followers. That alone was enough to raise suspicions. If this Jesus was truly the Messiah, wouldn’t he want everyone to know all his teachings? What were they hiding? It made no sense—if they had the truth, there would be no need for secrecy. The fact that some teachings were kept hidden only proved to John that this movement was shrouded in deception.\n\nAnd then there was the money. John wondered where all the money was going. He’d heard that the followers of Jesus were sharing their wealth, selling their property, and pooling their resources for some common cause. It sounded suspicious—was Paul, or one of the leaders, taking advantage of them for personal gain?\n\nDespite his disagreements with the Sadducees, at least they had the good sense to stick with the scriptures and tradition. They agreed on all that was essential for salvation. They weren’t making wild claims about new revelations, divine visitations, or extra scripture. The Sadducees were wrong about a lot, but at least they weren’t being fooled by a false Messiah like these Christians.",

It feels Im living a sick joke and  im just living for the little crumbs that life throws at me. The rest is just fighting and fighting and fighting... im tired.\n\n I do have my lovely girlfriend ive been with for 2 years. She isnt exactly the most stable mentally either but she is christian and a strong believer. It seems to give her something that i dont have. Ever since I've met her, ive been thinking about God a lot. But I cant convince myself that he exists. You know, the old thing that atheists always say: \"if there is a god then why does bad shit happen to good people\" yadayada yada. But really. I mean, this example is not related to me, but.. Unit 731.. if you know about it, then you know.\n\nThe things that happened there to presumably mostly innocent people, is beyond cruel. All these people did was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And their end was a death so unimaginably cruel and demonic, that it was able to just shatter my belief in any salvation.\n\nWe are just here, playing the hunger games or something. A product of probability. The outcome doesnt matter, as long as it works. Stuff like this can and will happen again. To innocent people. \n\nNow, christianity has hell. But that doesnt matter. These people still went through all of that suffering. Doesnt matter if the bad guys burn in hell for all of eternity. I dont give a fuck. I just dont want this stuff to happen. \n\nThese things are, to me, evidence that life and the universe is completely devoid of a higher purpose. And things like free will. Yea, its a controversial topic, but it seems that we are made up of particles and the interaction between particles make up our actions etc. This is proven, I believe. So, why should we believe that we can control our actions, when particles probably dont have free will either? So the whole concept of heaven or hell doesnt make sense to me either. \n\nIm not trying to bash christianity. I know christian people are humans just like me. You think similar things and go through similar things that i do. So, what am I missing? Maybe there is some key thing that could make me understand.\n\n Ive asked my girlfriend about it, but she has difficulty articulating it. Maybe its because she has been a believer since a child. \n\nI hope this is readable and understandable. I an very bad at keeping text short and concise.",

If it’s healthy, God approves and if it’s unhealthy, God disapproves.\n\nGive yourself to God entirely and God will help you to fill all of the holes and become complete once again.",

    "body": "This may be known, but for those who don’t know. I believe this is a massive thing to hear that will help with many battles of the urges of sin. \n\nSo, In all honesty, I am massively affected by lust. However, I have been trying to navigate it so much where I stop failing god and giving into my lustful nature. I had just recently came to a crazy revelation within myself that genuinely makes sense and I believe should be shared for those as naive as I was. \n\nWe all see the sins of the world and we deep down know the true reasons to the individual sins and it is the lack of individual discipline within ourselves. Our desire should be to live a life Jesus-like and adhere to the commandments. To go against these is to live without the discipline. \n\nJesus instructed in the Bible that we fast, I always seen it as interesting but seen it as face value how I imagine a lot of others seen it to thinking it literally meant you would get closer to god but it has many connections with it. \n\nSin is difficult and as we know as humans to break habits, you can’t just “stop”. It’s easy to say but not easy to put into practice without the necessary discipline behind you. When you look at all the teachings from both the Bible and Jesus, they all follow a principle of discipline rooted inside of them. \n\nIf you take Jesus’s suggestion to fast and connect it. It is the basic start for growing your personal discipline to bring you closer to god because the devil is the one who rebelled and being the one who rebelled, he lacked the discipline that was required. To rebel is lack of discipline in its simple ways. \n\nBy fasting, this is a fundamental practice to easily train our minds into mastering discipline because food is an urge all humans inevitably have but it is not a sin to eat. So using food as a growing stone by fasting and challenging yourself with your fasting is what strengthens the fortitude to eventually push this into other areas that reduce/remove our sins. \n\n I genuinely believe this will help many understand a way to approach the issues of sin within themselves to eventually get to the point they are looking to reach. \n\nTo further elaborate, for those who aren’t understanding on how fasting trains discipline is that food and water are necessities in our human lives. God has gave us them not only to live as humans but as tools to develop mentally and spiritually. It is a massive help for our discipline and we can utilise these tools to strengthen our mentality in areas we genuinely want to develop instead of seeing it how it is and just taking it for how it is. \n\nGrowth is key in this journey you just need to learn how you can grow in your own way that makes the journey as clear as possible.

We are beggars telling other beggars where to find food, as a pastor said on an Internet sermon. And as inter-religious marriages are uncommon in all religions, as looking at matrimonial advertisements in the newspaper might tell you, so they are uncommon in Christians as well. People generally tend to marry in their own religion, and Christians are no exception.\n\nAnd for a reason. Marriage is not just marriage between a man and a woman, but rather a marriage between two communities. You don’t want to intermarry with a bad community, do you? But seldom do people look at the faults of their own communities, if I might say.\n\nBut I want to know the absolute answer. Is marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian good?\n\nWell, I believe any marriage must be preserved and there should be no divorces, first of all. So, if someone marries a person from another religion, the marriage is to be preserved.\n\nBut apart from that, I can tell you these things:\n\n1. *The Book of Jonah* clears the dust from the eyes of the Jews (the Christians now), that people outside the Covenant are not bad. They are not your enemies, they are your friends. So marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian is fine.\n2. Solomon’s bride was the then Pharaoh’s daughter. *Song of Songs* is an erotic literature of the love between a Jew and a non-Jew. And it is the only Love Story in the Wisdom Literature in the Bible.\n3. *The Book of Ruth* tells the story of an outsider who married in and of whose lineage was born David. As Ruth herself said: ‘*your God will be my God.*’\n\nBut I claim to be no expert. As far as I am concerned, I will ask any prospective bride to tolerate my mental illness and a Jesus idol in the prayer space.",

It can apparently deprogram the human mind. \n\nWould that mean anal sex in heterosexual marriage should also be forbidden? I don’t know if most ppl view that as a sin I never actually thought about it before. It’s definitely not natural and prolly why porn \npushes it. Sodomy is anal sex hence Sodom? \n\n\n\n",

Tradesmen who shaped the metal would buy it from merchants who bought it from the miners in the form of bars of bronze, already mixed from copper and tin.\n\nThe issue was that many bars were of inferior quality possessing too much tin which resulted in brittle bronze. The merchants of course would say that they had been told it was good quality, whereas the forgers would report that it had been discounted for being imperfect batches, good for decorative work but not suitable for tools, to which the merchants were the ones being fraudulent by trying to sell it at full price.\n\nGnaeus Julius Agricola, leader of the Roman settlements at the time, made a ruling forbidding merchants from selling raw metal forcing the Tradesmen to buy directly from the miners which was the first codified example known of the \"He who smelt it, dealt it,\" rule.\n\n  \nIn clearing the backlog of such cases he also heard a dispute where a tradesman had complained he had acquired some bars of silver which had cores of lead to increase the weight so the seller could charge more for them.  The original miner insisted they were of sound quality when he sold them but they had passed through the hands of two separate merchants before reaching the end buyer.\n\nAgricola had the three men taken to different rooms and he went to the first, he said \"If the one who perpetrated this crime admits to it he shall pay a fine of 10 aureus to the man harmed, 10 times the claimed value of the silver bars.  If none of you admit to the crime you shall all be executed.  Now, did you commit the fraud?\"\n\nThe man thinks a minute before declaring \"I am guilty.\" Agricola leaves and goes to the second man and tells him the same.  This man too claims to be the guilty party.  Finally Agricola comes to the third man and gives him the same opportunity to admit to the crime, but this man proclaims his innocence.  Agricola wastes no time in sending his guards to behead the third man, for he knew \"it is he who denied it, that supplied it.\"",

On Sunday, I went to the store and got all my produce for the week: cabbage, carrots, broccoli, bok choy, peppers, etc. Then when I got home, instead of throwing them right into the fridge, I washed them all and cut them up, putting all the cut up veg into containers. I got two heads of garlic and chopped it all up in my food processor, also storing that in a container. I did the same thing with ginger but since I don't use that as much, I put the chopped ginger in a ziplock bag, pressing down to make it thin and then sticking it in the freezer. When I need ginger for a recipe, I'll just break off what I need. \n\nMy weeknight dinner routine has completely changed for the better.

    "body": "Most warranty deals are about 50% profit (I used to sell this stuff). This can be for cars or electronics or appliances, nearly anything. For example if you are quoted $4000 for a 4 year extended warranty for your car, then on average people would spend $2000 across 4 years or about $500 a year. Even if you do not plan to buy a warranty, you can use this to help plan for possible upcoming expenses or compare how your product is doing against the fleet average. \n\nRight now my Tesla is in the shop for what is estimated to be around $800, which would be really annoying except the warranty deal offered was $3100 for only 2 years, and I'm already 10 months into when that would have started. So as long as my upcoming costs are about $750 for the next 14 months, then my car is nothing special. \n\nA different example is a Fitbit watch, they offer a 2 year warranty for just $30, on a ~$200 watch. So this lets us know that problems are probably quite rare, and having gone through warranty replacement a few times I can tell you, they just replace them. So if the value of that warranty is $15, and a replacement refurbished one is around $100-150 cost, then its likely around 10% chance the watch goes bad in the second to third year (they only include a 1 year warranty in the US but 2 years in the EU). This example does use a few estimates, but helps us guess a failure rate by playing with the varialbes. \n\n(This LPT is not about IF someone should get a warranty, just how to use the pricing information to learn more about it)",

But I’m honestly not doing a darn thing as I only have 3 classes, twice a week. I have plenty of spare time. But that spare time was me wasting away in my bedroom thinking I was simply depressed, when I had bacterial overgrowth ripping me apart. Because of this I only work on Saturdays for around 5-6 hours making around $85. Which I use to buy my own food at home, gas, and supplements to fight the bacteria. \n\nBulk foods are pretty much nonexistent at the moment unless it’s frozen veggies, oatmeal and maybe potatoes but I’m not really supposed to be eating .

We live in a desirable neighborhood in a LCOL and bought in 2019 at a 3.29 interest rate (house was $229). We pay extra each month on the principal, and I believe we probably have $60-70k of equity now. Our mortgage is around 15% of our take home income, so it’s very comfortable. That said, we are having a baby in January and will up our health care, dependent care, and daycare costs, so I’m trying to figure out saving for college costs and how much leftover we really have to dedicate to investing in a 529.\n\nOn the other hand, I do feel like we could continue paying down the principal of our house until we could get a $50k HELOC for a downpayment of a second house and rent out the first house — not really to make much money on the rental, but to hold the asset so that in 18-20 years, we could sell it and have a substantial amount of money for college. Is this something that people do? My thought is that focusing on paying down our current mortgage/saving for buying a larger house in a few more years may be more feasible than saving the amount necessary each month in a 529. We should still contribute some to that, but I’m struggling to find the wiggle room in our budget knowing that childcare costs will be incurring and we’ll be bringing less take home each month due to dependent care and extra medical coverage deductions. \n\nSome additional information:\n1. When we bought the house, the bones had just been redone: new AC, new hot water heater, new electrical, new kitchen and bathroom, and they had to put on a new roof a couple years ago due to storm damage.\n2. I think we could move out of our “cool” neighborhood to the suburbs and get a bigger house for under $380k, which would make our payment maybe $800-1000 more than what we’re paying now.\n3. My one concern about our current house is our neighbor’s huge tree that abuts our backyard. She does not want to cut it down, despite it causing extensive damage to both of our houses, but I am hoping that if we maintain our side, that will protect our house.\n4. We have a little under $50k in HYSA and max our 401k contributions. I am taking a higher paying job soon which will bring our combined income to around $200k; however our families are poor, and we financially support both + they have no overhead to help us out in a pinch. \n\nLooking for any thoughts or advice.",

We can simultaneously do brokerage accounts with the small amounts they earn doing odd jobs at their Grandpa's shop (well, not the 6 yo just yet...or...can he?). But, i feel like they would get just as good a financial education watching money grow at a good rate as opposed to a measly .3% (or other junky) rate.

Our budget is $450k house and we will have around $70k cash on hand for down payment and closing costs (that is exclusive of $13k im saving for an e fund). I have an 811 credit score so my main question is: would paying off my remaining student loans have a *material* negative impact on the mortgage rate I’d get? My student loans are my oldest credit history so closing them out would presumably decrease my length of credit history, thus (slightly?) decrease my credit score, resulting in a (slightly?) worse mortgage rate. I’m sure I’m overthinking this but figure it’d be better to ask the masses before I pull the trigger.\n\nAdditionally, I’m curious if folks prefer paying them off, keeping the cash, or are indifferent between the two. I definitely see the side of it being nice to have the cash on hand while going through the home buying process but the other side of me thinks it’ll just be nice to be done paying off student loans.

I figure I can utilize a discount for clothing which wouldn’t hurt! \n*considered renting out a room but I’m iffy on that since I have young children\n*called my water company and worked out a payment plan so it doesn’t get shut off \n*received utility assistance \n*cut off internet and streaming for now \n*sold my camera \n*advertised to do bookkeeping for small businesses \n*applied for FT jobs that pay better and interviewed \n* made sure my meds are adjusted so I can avoid spiraling and repeating the cycle \n* considered donating plasma but I need to utilize a sitter while I do that \n*considered applying for child support but ex is violent and we had a no stalking order in place - iffy on that too\n\nI am open for a criticism and advice here.

Normally, I would absolutely just pull from the fund without a second thought, however we have a child in day care, and day care is not cheap.  We also plan on trying for number two next year with birth hopefully in 2026, so double day care.  I say this to bring up that I feel replenishing our Efund will be pretty challenging financially without dropping our retirement savings rate for a period / aggressively saving wherever we can for an extended period of time.\n\nAm I insane for considering a loan just to keep our Efund balance higher?

As such, she wants to have the trustee send money to us for us to then remit back to our friend\n\nI am struggling to find any such tax (or penalty?) laws and am just generally uncomfortable with the arrangement and it's legitimacy.

Apparently, the withdrawal limit is a policy limit per beneficiary on the life insurance and the \"tax\" penalty seems more of a policy penalty for withdrawing over the limit within a single year. The spouse of the deceased is the trustee of the funds and the surviving parent to the aforementioned friend. My suspicion is that the policy allows for additional discretionary withdrawals in addition to the named beneficiaries.",

I've been doing a ton of googling and listening to podcasts recently, trying to learn as much as I can, and I've put in a call to a financial planner for an initial consultation next week. I want to make sure I have all of my information and questions ready when I do meet with him, so I'm here to ask for some advice! From everything I've been researching, I feel like I'm in a pretty good place as far as employer retirement benefits go. I work a government job, and have almost 5 years of service with the State of Texas (ERS), and 8 years of service with the County where I currently work (TCDRS). There is some money in my ERS account, but I don't quite understand what that will get me later in life. The ERS website is not at all user friendly! I also have a TexaSaver 401(k) Plan through that job as well that has a tiny amount of money in it. My current TCDRS account is much easier to understand... I put 7% of my income into the account, the account grows by 7% interest every year, and when I retire my employer will provide a 200% match. I'm already vested, and only need 8 more years of service to be eligible to retire, meaning I could potentially retire at the age of 44! Other than that, I have a small personal savings account, but no other investments. This has all been a lot to think about, and I just want to be as prepared as I can be. What information should I have ready when I meet with the financial planner? What questions should I be ready to ask? Is there anything else I should be considering?

We need to do some repairs on our home, but we’re unsure of the best way to fund them. We have the money in our bank accounts to cover the costs, but we’re wondering if it’s smarter to take out a personal loan with smaller payments (and make extra principal payments) rather than withdrawing a large chunk of our savings at once.\n\nHere’s the situation: We have a pretty large yard and were quoted around $12,000 to replace our entire privacy fence. We live in an HOA (please don’t come at me for that), and the fence is due for replacement. We tried doing one side ourselves, but honestly, it didn’t turn out great. Plus, we have a toddler, and both work full time (I actually have 2 jobs) so finding time and a sitter to continue the work has been nearly impossible. So we’ve turned to contractors for quotes.\n\nIn addition, we’ll need to replace our floors down the road, though we’re holding off until our elderly pets pass (they’re both very old grandpas now). We’re also pretty sure our AC won’t last more than a few more years, so we’d like to plan for that expense as well.\n\nSo, to the personal finance experts out there: Should we pay for the fence out of pocket? Take out a personal loan and pay it off aggressively? And what about the floors and AC—would a HELOC be better for those future expenses?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",
